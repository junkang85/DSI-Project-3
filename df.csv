5,"Why Cyberpunk?I noticed in the thread about the changed style in the remake, that a lot of people are saying the original was Cyberpunk in aesthetic. I was wondering why? 

The original had plot themes associated with cyberpunk (corporate corruption etc.) but the visual style was Dieselpunk with heavy art deco influence, which is actually a lot more unique than cyberpunk. And that was only really in Midgar and Junon.

There aren't a lot of cyber punk elements for how long the game is. Some of the reactor interiors look cyberpunk, such as that lift and the Hojo related stuff, but just as many are plain industrial. 

Outside of that, here's a smattering of neon in Wall Market, otherwise most of the lighting appears to be normal light bulbs except green. The gold saucer is intentionally too garish to be cyberpunk (IMO).  Barret and Dyne have cybernetics but it is just those two. There's no internet, no vr.  The robots are mostly big chunky steampunk looking things, they actually look more cyberpunk now with the extra detail.

There's not a lot that is high tech or futuristic in FF7 outside the robot enemies. I think the most tech they show is a mobile phone. Which, again goes against the cyberpunk argument.

This close to release I'm sure if there were an actual system in place for this it would have been discussed in detail, so we won't see Dual and Triple Techs in the same style as Chrono Trigger (i.e. two characters sharing the ability).  This is more so using two abilities at once for greater damage.

55,"Debate about the Open City VS Linearity VS Semi Open ZoneHey there :) Just a little post to see what you guys would think since whe have a few info about it.

Recently, I've watch few streams of CC2 ""Dragon Ball Kakarot"". It seems that the game kept a certain mechanic (Time slowing down while chosing a capacity in combat. Huh... where did I saw that again ? :smirk: )  and choose to go for an ""Open World"" which is basicaly multiple ""wide"" area link through a map where you chose to teleport or not. 

I feel that I've saw this mechanic in JRPG lately : Kingdom Hearts 3 being one of the most recent one, multiple wide area connected to each other via loading screen or giant world map selection.  
(I'm not covering Zelda on purpose since it's not really a JRPG in my opinion)

It would really bother me to see Midgard getting the same treatment.

I would rather have a full explorable city rather OR a linear story but with wide zone to each segment. But not something halfway because well, dividing a city into zone wouldnt make much sense to me (if so, why not just remake the whole game like that ? )

What do you guys think ?",0

60,"Already stressed about deciding the battling systemAm I the only one with this problem already? Since the announce that the game is going to include a 'classical'-option for the battle system, I've been trying to decide should I play it with that option or the regular one. And the game is not even out yet. I'm not really that good at action games and I must admit that I often play them on easy mode (since I hate getting stuck on a boss with a million different navigation and action commands games have these days). What I've understood, the 'classical'-option for battle system basically handles the manual, regular attacking for you and you just choose the special moves like magic etc. I wonder if it will get boring like that and if the difficulty can be changed afterwards. Anyone else contemplating this?",0
61,"What's your playstyle likely going to be?The way I see it there'll be 5 or so different playstyles available;

**Action** Pretty simple, utilising a more action oriented style using shortcuts and combos, likely to stick to a main character and swap only when necessary, possibly just issue commands without switching.

**Classic** As the mode suggests, playing the game in classic mode, switching between characters to use ATB abilities as they pop up

**Main Character Focused** Sticking to a single character who you'd main and issueing commands to the rest without switching, while still heavily using the command menu.

**Switch on a wim** This is seemingly the most popular playstyle based on demo playthroughs I've seen, basically just run with a character until you get bored and then switch to another, rinse and repeat, generally ends up with ATB bars being saved longer than they really should be.

**ATB &amp; Switch** This is probably going to be the most min maxed way to play, basically just using a character until their ATB gauge is full, expeding the bars then switching to the character with the second highest atb, getting theirs up and rinse and repeat.

I think I'm likely to play more towards the ATB &amp; Switch style, it seems to be that nice middle ground between the original and the new, I was a bit disapointed at there seemingly not being a way to switch the directionals with R2 + L2 as I'd find that a much more comfidable way to switch so frequently, but the dualshock back paddle has got good reviews so I might splash out for that which will achieve the same function.

70,"Am I the only one who is hoping they include a ""classic"" combat mode?I would like to preface this with the fact i am not a FFVII purist or fangirl, in fact my top fav FF game is FFIII(SNES)/VI. That being said, I merely enjoy classic JRPG combat systems more than action based ones.

What I mean is they make it so that you have ""action mode"" where you can actively use attacks and such like in the action rpg style but in classic mode, it plays similarly to how the original FF7 played with you manually inputting commands.

Honestly, based on what I've seen, this wouldn't be too hard given that tactical mode already allows you to slow things to a near standstill to begin with. It wouldn't be that big of a stretch to believe that a ""classic mode"" could merely pause foes in place with bouts of action taking place after each command has been inputted followed by another pause after all foes and player actions have executed.

Though EXTREMELY UNLIKELY they could go the extra mile and have classic mode literally be identical to the classic FFVII combat system completely with random encounters just with updated graphics and a few extra quick time events during combat.

This is of course wishful thinking on my part and i'm sure FFVII Remake will be good no matter how it turns out but I would admit that it would be a huge nod to FF fans IF they did include a class mode.

71,"Why does the Eng version of FFVII Remake have so many differences from the Jp version? (no leak info) (enemy/ability name spoilers)I'm getting the Japanese version of Remake and as such I've been fallowing the news in both languages and I've noticed a some things in the Eng version that make me scratch my head. 

The biggest one is the decision to get a completely new voice cast even for characters nobody ever had a problem with like Reno, whereas in Japan seemingly all the old voice cast is getting their roles back. Some people might say ""who cares? the Eng AC voice cast was never good in the first place"", and while I don't necessarily disagree with that, Could's Eng VA already showed in Crisis Core he can play a ""non emo"" Cloud so it's not really necessary to change it. 

But also, the Japanese voice cast had a similar situation as well. Tifa's Japanese VA was considered the worst one in KH2 and AC (and she kinda was), but over time she improved, to the point where in World of FF and now in Remake the Jp fans are very happy with her performance. Long story short, it is completely possible for a VA to improve over time.

But it's not just the voices that are different, enemy and ability names are as well. Guard Scorpion is now Scorpion Sentinel, Blade Beam is now Blade Blast and it seems Motor Ball is now M.O.T.O.R but in Japan they're the original names.

Mainly I'm curious who made these decisions, the Japanese side or the american side? If it was the Japanese side why wouldn't they be making the same changes to that version? If it's the american side why go out of the way to make all these changes? Is this just a case of ""overzealous localization"" rearing it's ugly head again because somebody at US Square thinks the original names are ""too silly"" or ""no one's gonna take it seriously""?

tldr: Various enemies and abillites are getting new names in English and the entire Eng voice cast is different but in Japanese it's all the same as the original and I don't get why.",0

86,"OG7, 7R, and Aerith. Potentially Massive Spoilers inside.So it was suggested that the Whispers of Fate only appear when the story deviates from the original and this got me thinking a lot. Basically it comes down to that if chapter 1 and 3 are all OG7 content and chapter 2 is new content the Whispers would only appear in chapter 2. So in this way the story of the Whispers would be a separate one that runs parallel to the OG7 story without ever fully overlapping.


This also creates a major opportunity to expand on the lore and do some other crazy things but effectively change nothing. Here's where it gets really wild though, it's a big if, but if Nomura approached it in this fashion the remake could include two versions of the game. One being the remake story with all the new content and another version that simply skips the chapters involving the Whispers to keep the purist fans happy. That OG version of the game would be shorter but it would be a great addition. Another major benefit is that this wouldn't take any serious extra effort to develop, it's essentially a boolean switch that says to skip certain chapters if playing the OG version.


Now building on this. In this hypothetical side story of the remake we can (likely in part 3) have a sort of Avengers Endgame plot that involves going back and preventing Aeriths death. By splitting the games into two game types OG and Remake this won’t hurt the OG version for purist fans as it would only occur in the Remake story and include the Whispers of Fate. Here’s the big thing though, the Aerith lives portion of the remake story would tie back into the OG story when it is realized that Aerith has to sacrifice herself to call Holy. At this point Cloud and the gang use whatever power of the ancients to summon up the Whispers to ensure the story is set on a path that leads to Aeriths death. This would also help to build closure for Cloud with her death, he was able to see what happens if she were to survive and comes to terms that this is how things had to be for the world to be saved. 


In this way the game would be almost a meta sequel/prequel to OG7 while still keeping the OG7 part of the game intact and playable without the Whipsers. We'd also get a chance at seeing that alternate world where she survives despite that it ultimately ends in tragedy.

Edit: Everyone's acting like I think they should change the games story, I don't. Fact is they already changed it by adding the Whispers of Fate. It's going to be different. I'm just suggesting how having a classic and remake story mode would be cool as we'd have the option to experience the Whispers or not. Also if the Whispers don't appear until major new story events happen it would be easy to implement these two story versions without reworking every bit of the game.",0

&amp;#x200B;

I dont mean to burst everyone's bubbles, but this upcoming chapter is without a doubt the easiest part of the game to adapt to modern tastes. It all gets harder from here, and we'll be signing onto this series of games with this purchase without the real questions answered.  


For instance, The Midgar section of FF7 serves in many ways as the world's longest intro scene. The entire thing is heavily scripted, on rails, and framed to be cinematic. This is right in the wheelhouse of a modern ARPG presentation.  


But after this, we have amorphous goals, globetrotting, towns that serve little purpose, overworld exploration, and a massive narrative shift that goes from cyberpunk action adventure to exploring a largely rural, low tech world at your leisure. There's also the dating system which will now span across a minimum of two games to track player input (assuming its implemented like it was), Cait Sith and the entire can of worms he represents, and massive stretches where the narrative beats often have multi-hour gaps in between. We've seen and heard not a thing about how mechanics as simple as the airship will be handled. Full planet exploration? (unlikely), Menu selection of desired destination? How about the fact that the game becomes one long convoluted existential crisis? Or that nearly all the Sephiroth sightings are really Jenova cells doing a John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" impression of Sephiroth, and that that only truly becomes clear after the first playthrough?  


Basically, Final Fantasy 7R will have a 'Two Towers' moment, where the whole narrative forces some radical decision making in order for the presentation to work just like the breaking of the fellowship did for the film adaptations.  


I'm rather positive they're gonna stick the landing of episode one. Its a straightforward good versus evil adventure story. I'm far less convinced the subsequent entries will be able to do the same. And then we'll all be reliving a 'The Force Awakens' nightmare, with a first episode that seems like a solid foundation all followed up by nightmare fuel we'd all rather pretend didn't happen.",0

Just checked my account and its showing the 11th as the estimated date! I know its probably due to it being Good Friday which is a bank holiday here in old Britania, but I know I've had deliveries from other game retailers on bank holidays before with no issues.

Hope you're well and having a good week. 

Any posters/lurkers that fancy commenting here from the UK that have pre-ordered FF7R through base.com? They're my usual go-to in terms of pricing and reliability with pre-orders.

Emailed them following the delay and they said in the event of a bank holiday weekend (Easter weekend when FF7R releases) that they 'usually' get the game the day before and distribute it accordingly.

I'm wondering if it's worth being optimistic and holding on to hope for this, or if a cancellation is worth it and seeing if there's somewhere I could grab it from on the Friday morning as a guaranteed alternative?

Any input would be appreciated, thank you!",0

I've seen people stressing over this delay because it's looking like another FFXV.... From everything we've seen and played (at expos) it's absolutely nothing like XV. The story is already established because of the OG and areas are already well known and are just being rebuilt.

103,"Speculation - Affection System in Remake?Hi all. This is my first post. I hope this isn't a repetitive topic. =)

So in the OG game there was a really fun affection system that I loved. I replayed the 1st disc so many times just because I wanted to get all the date scenes. XD Since the game is being split into parts how do you think the affection system will work? In the original game the Midgar portion had a good amount of opportunities to increase or decrease affection values for the dateable characters that were presented (ex. Aerith giving Cloud the flower).  However, since the remake only covers Midgar it might be silly to even include the affection values here because Gold Saucer isn't available as a reward. 

Do you think the affection system will just not be used in the Midgar version of the remake? Do you think they'd have an affection system with a small reward/cutscene towards the near-end of the game? If so, maybe including Jessie in the affection system as a replacement for Yuffie? Do you think that it'll be only introduced in Part II? How would you like the affection system to work? Do you think SE has the foresight/ability to let affection values transfer over to the next parts?",0

Not so sure how happy my bosses will be if I continually change my dates. 😅

126,"The very smooth transition from pre-rendered cu-tscene to real-time graphicsHi, I was staring really close at the screen to find differences between pre-rendered and real-time stuff. And like always with Final Fantasy, it's just commendable how very smooth they handle the transition between pre-rendered videos and actual ingame graphics rendered by your local PS4 in real time. 

https://preview.redd.it/swsmv8ud8ra41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bf9467310f2def4ff4769db5c80f20e8417843

After smoke comes up, which makes the screen flash up to white, the video is exchanged with real-time graphics while the smoke fades. The camera is also moving forward in a steady way so it's really almost unnoticeable. Only on the screenshots above you can see a slight change in the lighting tone. 

Don't judge the game's graphics too much based on this last screen. I zoomed into the video footage's upper left corner to focus attention on the train yard's details here and the game also appears to implement some variable resolution. So the aliased legs of the soldier would appear completely smooth a second later. I tried some pixel-counting, but it's really hard in this game. There is some excellent post-processing that smoothes out aliasment all the time and the geometry is too complex to find good edges when not playing myself.

All the details on the background are kept in tact from the pre-rendered sequence and the train seems identical. But some details are added on the left after the transition. However, it's hard to tell as the angle is not entirely the same, because the camera is constantly moving forward as stated above. 

I can't wait to get my hands at the game. I have so much nostalgia and love for the game's story, world and music. But I also love how gorgeous the remake looks. Not just from the technical side, but also aesthetically.",0

I have this feeling, hopeful anyways, that the overworld will be handled in an ala FFXV type of way, but less empty overall. 

Like, I can imagine the chocobo ranch guy we meet outside Kalm before going through the swamp to be like the chocobo ranch guy from XV. Just one building, maybe a small barn attached to it, chocobos posted up outside and such then further out we get to the actual swamp, etc. But like Kalm itself, being an actual town we can walk into and through. 

Same for all the other areas of the game, especially places that didn't really get a great deal of attention to them (had to google search cause my memory isn't that hot) such as Bone Village or Mideel, including side quests and things to explore lore on areas they really just kind of brushed over, likely due to memory constraints in the OG.

137,Game delayed; Will they release the demo now?Hey everyone after seeing the official post by Square Enix regarding the delay (April 10th 2020 is the new release date) Do you think they will release the demo to soften the blow? Surprised it wasn't apart of the official statement as i think it would have been a nice gesture and a good means to keep the hype up and good marketing what is everyones thoughts on this?,0
138,"How knowing that there's a planned demo has made me feel so far (TLDR at the end)Note : Sorry if my English hurts you, not my native language.

I don't know if some of you can relate, but since the leaks about the demo being updated to the psn, I'm not myself anymore.

Let me explain with a bit of backstory :

Since the Tech demo that was made to show off the graphic potential of the PS3, many years ago, I was desperately hoping, every single year, during every single E3 event, that square would announce a remake.

Years go by, one after the other, without any trace of a remake.

The year when I thought ""oh well, fine, I get it, they won't ever do it..."" BOOM, the news came in like a wrecking ball (yes), an earthquake in the world of gaming, gave goosebumps to every single FFVII fanboys and fangirls out there (I wish I was in the audience at E3 that day). Hope was back and from that first announcement, I knew SE would give us the best FF experience, putting love in the game like never before. I never doubted, for me, SE will make this game AWESOME.

So we come to know the date, March 3rd, which seemed so far for me... I first played the OG with my cousin back when I was 9 (now 31) and I think I played it more than ten times over the years. I completed it only once 100% for the challenge. I played it again recently, for the good old memories. Also to help make the time pass faster, I guess.

Through this November, I was obviously hoping for a demo to be released as a Christmas or new year's gift from SE.

That's where the leaks fucked with my mind.

I do honestly think that I could handle the wait better if that leak was kept secret (which, well, doesn't make it a leak anymore) or at least that I would never hear of it. I thought the demo would definitely come out during the holidays, which would somehow have been the greatest gift of all for the fan I am. So far, I was at least able to keep me away from any video showing the leaked demo and what's inside it, because I want to protect my hype.

So, the time goes by, holidays are now over, and still no sign of the demo on the psn...

I swear, since that psn leak, I've been waaaaaaaaaaay too often refreshing this sub, SE and FFVIIR's twitter accounts, all the gaming channels I subscribed on youtube, searching for any news, any announcement, any hint on when the demo will finally drop... I mean, I can't concentrate well at everything I'm doing just because I want that demo so hard. It feels like a drug I need so I can feel better. And god how the time has been slowing since then. I still wonder why they uploaded it so soon to the psn though.

At this point I wish they never prepared a demo, because every single day that passes without the demo being available feels like a worthless and empty day.

Am I the only one?

TLDR; I'm some kind of wandering ghost in my life since the demo leak, waiting for one and only one thing, being able to play it before the game comes out. I feel empty. Please help.

EDIT : Brace yourselves my friends, it's official, the game is being delayed to April 10th... I feel dead inside right now XD Please give the demo SE. PLEASE.",0

FFX so far has the best pre rendered cutscenes, like the iconic kiss scene in the forest, saving yuna, summons diminishing while yuna tried to hug tidus and many more.

FFXIII has a lot too, my favorite was shiva transformation

FfXV is when it started to have small amount of pre rendered cutscenes, opening/ luna  in the water/ end

I really hope they should add more in FFVII

So far we only seen the opening aerith/midgar
The teaser from 2015 trailer(cloud &amp; barrets back)  which most likely wont make it in the final game..

143,"My Wishlist for Trophies. (OG ff7 spoilers)So I am hyped to get my platinum for FF7R and I cannot wait to dig into the meat of the achievements that Square decides to put into the game. I've based this list of achievements off two things.   
1. Story elements and game elements from the original game

2. Guestimations of what kind of expansion we'll see if FF7R.   
Note: None of these achievements have any basis of creation from any of the demo leaks. There should not be any spoilers in my list that aren't simply spoilers for the original game. 

Also this is an excuse to think of funny names for things.   


Let's begin.   
Story trophies.   
15-20 trophies out of the gate will be dedicated to story progression and possibly difficulty so I am just gonna generalize this number for direct progression within the story.   


General Achievements  
Mapped my Escape: Successfully escape in less that 20 minutes (based on the TGS footage when you set the bomb you have an option to choose 30 or 20 minutes. This achievement requires you to pick the lesser time of 20 and successfully escape)  
Self-Repair Offline: Disable the Guard Scorpion's shield before it can heal itself  
Flower Girl: Buy a flower from Aerith  
Little Angel: Give Marlene a flower  
Childhood friends: Give Tifa a flower.  
Soldier Buster: Defeat Air Buster with X minutes remaining (we've seen in trailers that there is a countdown timer for this boss, this achievement wants you to beat it while still having a certain portion of time remaining)

Weapon Apprentice: Level up a weapon  
Materia Enhancer: Level up a Materia

Materia Hunter: Collect all Materia's

Soldier's Arsenal: Collect all of Cloud's weapons

Fists of Fury: Collect all of Tifa's weapons

Gun Armed: Collect all of Barrett's weapons

Baton pass: Collect all of Aerith's weapons

Skills to pay the bills: Unlock all weapon skills. 

Master Materia: Master a Materia 

Mako Sponge: Master all Materias

Limit Broken: Collect all Limit Breaks

Hello Beautiful: Corneo chose Cloud 

Bullseye: Hit a bullseye on the dartboard  
Pro Aim: Do really good at darts (i dunno what this means, but whatever doing good at darts would mean is worth a trophy)

Leg day: Defeat all the squat gym battles 

Upper Body Strength: Defeat all pull up battles

The Bees Knees: Do something at the Honey Bee Inn.

Road Rash: Win a Bike battle

Ride to Hell: Win the championship bike battle (or however mastering this probable mini game works)

Just Call Him Red: Meet Red XIII (he's probably in the game eventually right?)

Who takes the stairs anyway?: Sneak into the Shinra Bldg 

Avalanche will see you now: Break into the Shinra Bldg

I choose you: Use a Summon During combat

Double Whammy: Use two summons in the same combat (dunno if this is possible, but on a longer boss fight it might be possible to summon twice in one battle)

Evasive Maneuvers: Dodge X attacks in a single fight  
Weak to what?: Defeat Aps without using Fire

Got Your Back: Save a character when grabbed by an enemy.

Good Dog: Defeat Rufus without killing his dog (again who knows how this fight will be remade, but if he has a dog dont kill the dog)

Minions Avoided: Defeat the experiment without killing it's minions (again this is hojo's experiement with the little minon dudes he always brings back, dont kill them at all, get an achievement)  
Jacked: Steal an item from a boss (assuming steal is in the game)

Shortcut Master: Defeat a boss without entering slowdown mode (using only shortcutted commands and never using bullet whatever time)

165,"Question of Preference Regarding Red XIII:I've noticed since I joined this sub that a lot of people clash against what to call him. Nanaki, Red XIII, Red, XIII, or anything the player decides even. What do you call him and why do you call him that? Do you disapprove of calling him a different name?

I'm genuinely curious, as since the time after I had first learned the name given to him by his family, I have always named him Nanaki unless the run is just a messing around run, where I name the characters something that sounds cool or comedic. 

That being said, I don't have anything against somebody that calls him Red, or Red XIII (although, personally, saying Red XIII everytime I saw it in the dialogue was a cognitive mouthful, which likely helped influence my decision to change his nickname to his real name), I'm just curious if there is any reason you prefer one option over any of the others.

With all this in mind, any thoughts on how his name will be spoken in the remake? I feel like the team will use Red for the most part, occasionally calling him Nanaki when the future parts of the game release. I have high doubts we will hear him be called Red XIII more than a couple times, those couple being said for the finale of this first part of the remake.",0

For example, if I played part 1 and leveled my party to level 99 and had all materia etc available in the game then surely this would be way too OP for Part 2 which would suggest you would have to start again from scratch. 

I do not know any spoilers from the leaks so going off what I have read previously about the game I believe not all summons etc are available in part 1 which in my mind would make me think that you would retain Ifirit and others available in Part 1 for use in Part 2 and beyond which would contradict starting from scratch.

176,"What story element would you like to see expanded in FFVIIR?Inspired to ask this question after reading another thread that mentioned the Cetra, whose history I think would definitely be a strong candidate for deep narrative expansion in the remake. What's nice about the history of the Ancients is that it's been relatively untouched by the sequels and prequels, so there are fewer hoops and obstacles to navigate in telling their story and deepening our understanding of what they were doing before Jenova landed on the planet, how they handled 'the calamity' and what the aftermath of that battle was like. Flip side of that same coin, I'd love to have a better understanding of what Jenova's origins. Is it from a planet of other similar lifeforms? Is it merely a parasite that travels through the void of space looking for a host planet? With the episodic breakdown of the game, including possible DLC down the line, it would be nice if we could get a deeper understanding of the backstory and not necessarily just new minigames, gameplay elements, Roche-type characters, etc.

191,"[NO-SPOILER] - Is there still hope that the demo will be released before March 3rd? 🤔I don't have the demo, and I haven't seen anything from the demo. I haven't even seen the latest trailers (I stopped at the first gameplay trailer that was shown). So please don't spoil anything. I've never even played the original game!

However, I knew that the last screen of the demo allows you to choose the version of FFVIIR to buy. This is the only thing I have seen from the stolen demo, and I took a screenshot from a YouTube video of the full demo. Here it is.

https://preview.redd.it/5z2wqhkwws941.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d561208630512fc9f6ca953291bbc5ef828ad52c

It seems that at the end of the demo there is a screen to ""purchase"" the game, not to ""pre-order"" it.

If the demo release had been scheduled before the release of the actual game, the screen would probably have been ""Pre-Order Now!"". It is true that to make a preorder it is necessary to pay the full price, therefore one might think that the word ""purchase"" is used in a generic way. But the pre-order bonuses are missing in the game versions shown on the screen.

So let's resign... those who pre-ordered the game will probably never play the demo, because the demo will most likely be released together with the full game.

**Edit:**

* There is still hope for the FFVIIR demo! 🤗👦🏼🔪
   * As it was written in the comments (thank you all), apparently the *Devil May Cry V* demo also had a ""purchase"" screen and was released before the full game. Obviously I didn't know.
   * Also, again from the comments, It was pointed out that the stolen demo is a part of an obviously unfinished version of the game, probably with some bugs, or the like. It would not be suitable for advertising the game after launch. I don't know if this means that a second demo will be released in the future, but we'll see. But as for the stolen-demo we're all waiting for, it would make more sense to release it during this month.",0

I've been thinking about this for the past few days and I don't think we're gonna see a demo until well into February at the earliest.
The very simple reason is that The KH3 Dlc is being released later this month.
Were I in charge of marketing I would make sure the KH3 Dlc does not compete with attention for the frankly way more anticipated FFVIIR, which includes making sure the FF Demo doesn't drop around the same time KH Dlc is being released. 
A lot of people here seem to think that there's not point for SE to hold the Demo now, but you forget that we are a minority.
Most people who are going to buy the game has no idea about the leak.
I talked to my brother earlier today, my brother who is as much a gamer as I am, but doesn't have the same passion for FF as me. He didn't know the demo had been leaked. My jaw dropped at first, but then I thought about it, and I repeat; we are a minority.

It is in SE's best interest to keep going with the marketing plan as if nothing happened, and honestly, were I in charge I would probably do the same.
Sure it sucks for us few who check this sub several times a day, hungry for more info. But what we want does not define what's best for SE.

It's a focus of hardcore fans, but as for the 8-10 million people who purchase the game, I would wager a large portion of them will buy it based on marketing hype built throughout February and through the demo.

I was wondering if there has been any word in the remake to implement some sort of **AI behavioural system**? Such as enabling certain actions under certain conditions for the AI during combat?

I might've missed it during the presentations given to us so far (please correct me if I'm wrong!), but it seems the **AI only blocks and perform basic attacks** and does not spend ATB unless given manual commands to during combat.

This just popped into my head when I was watching some FFXII stream and they talked about the gambit system. I'm completely new to the idea of that games gambit system so I'm not sure if it's overly complicated or simplified. It just reminded me that it'd be nice to have some control over friendly AI without having to switch over characters to spend ATB all the time.

Anyway, looking forward to the game :)

Just think about it, how many franchises can you name off the top of your head that you used to love, but now money grabbing corporations have squeezed them for cash? Remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, some are better than others and some are absolutely atrocious.

Just imagine a world where FF7, this beloved game from our childhoods, gets remade and all of us play it and say ""What did they do?? Cloud's character is all wrong, they didn't get the music right, and why am I on a casino planet when there's supposed to be a spaceship battle going on??""

It could have happened to FF7, but it didn't. I mean I know we haven't played it yet but we've all seen the trailers and at least some of the leaks, and the universal consensus is that they got it right. I've never seen a company show this much respect for it's fan base and honor the legacy of the work being remade. It's just a beautiful thing to behold.

My friends and family all tell me how much they love Harry Potter or Star Wars or whatever else, and I have to explain that my favorite story, with music that still touches my emotions to this day, is an old video game with quirky graphics. SE has brought it into the modern era, newcomers can finally understand what we're all talking about, and the rest of us are satisfied too.

269,"A simple life analogy [regarding the leaks] that would explain why the Devs for FFVIIR are disappointed, regardless of the hype generated. (A rant of sorts for people saying it shouldn't be an issue since people are hyped)Have you ever given anyone a present? Have you ever gone out shopping to find the perfect present to give someone important to you, the perfect surprise?

After all that effort, you figure out that someone told that person what you're giving them, and they're really excited for it. You know they're genuinely happy about it, yet you'd still feel disappointed. You do care about them being happy, but \[as selfish as we are as humans\] you want to see those emotions come from you handing them that gift and them opening it in front of you. You want to be the direct source of such emotions.

I'm pretty sure Square Enix knows about all the hype, they're not stupid. They want the reactions directly coming from them revealing things. They're still humans with selfish human desires. They still want that self-gratification as much as we do when we make a conscious effort for other people. For pete's sake, this is their pet project for the decade.

We watch reaction videos to reveals just so we can hype ourselves further. We hear others scream ""WHAT?!?"" or ""OMG THEY DID IT!"" or something along those lines the first time certain items get revealed, but with leaks and spoilers going around, it's inevitable that some people will bump into them, so when they're revealed \[be it intentional or unintentional\], some reactions will be muddled with prior knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

As much as game devs want hype to generate, they want themselves to be the source of such hype, and I don't think we can fault them for that, they're still human after all, and that's why a lot of us feel bad for them and understand why they want to reveal things scheduled.

I'm going to enjoy the voice actors having made little lines and comments that will hopefully develop throughout the game like Barret being wary of the new mercenary Cloud then that growing to be a friendship and Cloud being seen as a leader.

Add a few serious and non serious side quests, maybe give him a superboss to crush under his boot easy that would give your party hell later in the game.

Most people have played the original FF7 long before there was even an idea that a remake was going to happen. They all know what the story is and people keep telling me about the nostalgia they're having and being excited and it's their best FF game ever. I've never played 7. I don't know the story. I don't even know the characters very well besides Cloud is in Smash and some of them are in Kingdom Hearts. I'm totally blind going into this.

If I play it before the new release I'd see the complete story just before the Remake Part 1 comes out. I'd get to experience what it was originally and appreciate what changes/additions they made and if they add any references or easter eggs. But it might make the remake less surprising/shiny to me. And I wouldn't be reliving a nostalgia most everyone else is going to because it'll be played back to back.

If I play it after the new release, I'll be coming out of a first parter of a whole story, I think? And then I'll be excited to see what the rest of the story is. But I'll also have to replay what I just played in a drastic downgrade visually and gameplay mechanics wise.

291,"Summons in the remake confirmed and speculationsObviously the preorder DLC summons that will most likely be pay for dlc at a certain date separate from the game, and then the three summons we've seen in official screenshots and trailers.  


Chocobo Chick  
Cactuar  
Carbuncle  
Chocobo and Moogle ( aka: Choco/Mog )  
Shiva  
Ifrit  


Which is quite a lot considering in the OG you didn't get your first summon until After you leave Midgar.  
And the summons are quite different, they aren't just one big MP cost big hit attack, they require a bit more to be able to be summoned- perhaps the more powerful summons have heavier requirements and the weaker ones can be called out more often, but they join you in battle and assist you for a while with other attacks and buffs before doing their big finale and leaving.  


Now for speculating-   I think that Chocobo Chick and Chocobo and Moogle are going to be one and the same materia.  
I think that as you level up the materia, once it hits second or third star you might start having a chance to summon chocobo and moogle rather than just chocobo chick every time, and then when you max out the materia you'll have a chance of getting Fat Chocobo to appear instead.    
Otherwise, it just feels heavy on chocobo materia, imo...  ;)  


I'd like to think that perhaps all the summon materia could follow suit and hence you'll see additional attacks and powered up summons as the materia levels up towards mastered.  Perhaps Cactuar could become a Jumbo Cactuar or a whole group of Cactuars, even Cactuar King ? :P  Carbuncle might master out with assistance from Phoenix or have a more powerful rainbowy AoE ability than he initially had.  


Then the last bit of speculating, I think for a full fledged final fantasy title--     
I think the final summon acquired would be Bahamut for this game, and while it would be cool for him to change into Bahamut Neo then Zero-  perhaps those would be left for the next installments.

The game has been in development for quite some time, and has been switching studios and pretty much been ""rewritten"".

Imagine if SE intentionally put in old material in the demo, just so people would go crazy and also getting some free headlines? Think about it, all the material that is around is now being marketable by the players alone, wich means they get free marketing.

But what we dont know is that this might be heavily outdated material, so it might not spoil anything major at all? Me myself have not been looking through the leaked content, so i dont know what it looks like, but a part of me is hoping that this was all intentional and that this was their plan all along.

332,"Barret's Backstory and AVALANCHE - is this new?I was checking out the remake's official website, and this part of Barret's character description stood out to me:

&gt; The leader of an independent Avalanche cell in Midgar, Barret was disavowed by the old guard for his extreme methods that attracted too much attention. He subsequently came to Midgar, where he resolved to continue to pursue his vendetta against Shinra with a small but trusted group of followers.

My memory of the original game is foggy, but I recall Barret being the leader of AVALANCHE, which consisted only of the members shown in Midgar early on. This says that there is a larger AVALANCHE organization from which Barret broke off, and his actions now are independent of it. What does this mean for the game? Is this a way to instigate criticism of Barret's methods within the story? Could we, at some point, meet the main AVALANCHE organization? What does this mean for the game?",0

This game is going to be H U G E. Exploring the entirety of Midgar, expanded activities throughout the slums, and there will likely be more hints to the overall plot of the game, as evidenced by footage of Cloud arguing with a temporally-displaced Sephiroth, whereas we don't know much about Sephiroth/Jenova/Ancients until around Costa Del Sol (original).

342,"What she saw in the allyAfter seeing the demo intro, I’ve developed a theory on Aerith,  whatever the ‘Watchmen of Fate’ might be, and why she’s afraid.
I made  a comment, but I feel it warrants a post.

[When she abruptly looks towards the alley, stands up, and runs away in fear as we hear the slight hint of Sephiroth’s theme in the intro,](https://imgur.com/gallery/FNOSJiX) it was obviously hinting at something very big at play. My theory (and that’s all it is, so go easy) is I feel like Aerith will see her death very early on in a sort of premonition due to these Watchmen of Fate. She’s terrified of them because they show her her future, or ‘fate’, but she doesn’t know why.

Obviously she would hide this from the others (and the player) with only subtle hints to the OG players that she foresees her death.
Perhaps she will carry this premonition throughout the game and will hide it until she knows the details and exactly why she has to make that sacrifice (the conversation in the Sleeping Forest)

353,"Regarding things we saw later in the demo. MASSIVE SPOILER, DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ABOUT FFVII AND THE REMAKE.Recently in the demo, they showed that the first reactor was an inside job. And this bothers me. Because it removes a certain moral ambiguity of Barret as a character and Avalanche's. They could still write it in a way that Avalanche/Barret never knew that ShinRa is behind the first reactor bombing. From the character's perspective, they still shoulder the blame of ""killing""  the innocent. But it's how we, the player perceive the character. In the old game, the ""blood"" of the people fallen from the Reactor 1 explosion is on Avalanche/Barret's hands. It's why in a later scene, where Cait Sith/Reeves confronts the hypocrisy of Avalanche's actions, the guilt felt from Barret felt real. And from then he understood what needs to done, what wrongs that he need to do right. It's good character writing. Now their removing that aspect, how do we perceive Barret/Avalanche now, as a character? Just another fantasy hero that never do anything wrong? That's not what makes him a good character. Then what will happen to the scene where Cait Sith/Reeves confronts Barret. Are we going to see two people bickering over things that one guy accuses the other that he never did? Square promised that they won't be alter the story, but in this case they are, in my opinion, is ruining a beloved character. I genuinely don't know WHY the change is needed in the first place. The way they're handling it in the old game is already perfect. Why change it for, in my opinion, the worse? Sorry, had to vent. I like everything from the demo, except that part. Yes, it's nitpicky, I know, does it mean I'm wrong? Maybe, let's discuss.",0

375,"[Discussion] My concernsDon't get me wrong, I'm SUPER hyped for FFVII Remake, but I'm also a little worried. Tell me why I'm wrong to worry about these things:

**1. How are saves going to be transferable across episodes?**

I presume the PS4 has a way to make this a reality and I should just not worr**y.**

**2. Will each episode cost $60? So I'm paying $180 to $240 for the remake? :-/**

Maybe this can be justified in terms of pure gameplay hours and what's being added. I don't know. Hmm. I can only presume the final episode will ultimately be sold as a ""complete"" game for a MUCH reduced price.

**3. What's to stop everyone grinding their characters until Episode 2 is released (and so on)?**

Won't that just make the game really unbalanced? If Squeenix make the game automatically adjust difficulty to your character's level, won't that annoy everyone (it would annoy me, if I've grinded my characters and they're suddenly weak in the next episode).

**4. Will each episode keep growing in size?**

Given that a large part of the game becomes open world, allowing you to visit the game locations over and over, and presuming the open-world section will be divided across episodes, that means the subsequent episode (eg. Episode 3) will have to contain all the areas from Episode 2, and all the new areas for Episode 3. And if you're in Episode 4 and you decide to leave the Crater (assuming that's Episode 4), then you'll want to also be able to visit the same areas from Episodes 3 and 2.

Or will the game just keep installing in the same location, adding system files, and I'm worrying about nothing?

**5. Why don't they know how many episodes there'll be? Haven't they planned out the game yet?**

It's a bit worrying that they're adding so much to episode 1, if they're unsure where the game is going. Hmm. I guess we just have to trust them.

**6. Will FFVII Remake be finished on the PS5?**

The PS5 has an estimated release date for the end of 2020 (dev kits and hardware specs are already out). The earliest the Remake is realistically going to be finished is 2023? (Do people agree with that estimate? Thinking 1.5 years for 2 more episodes, seems pretty conservative. It'll probably be 2024 at the very earliest.) So the PS4 is surely going to be a largely dead or dying machine two/three/four years into the life of the PS5. Sqeenix will probably want to finish the game on the current gen console... so how is that going to work?

Will we have to buy the ""Remastered"" Remake for the PS5??

Tell me why these are not valid concerns!!!

EDIT: It tickles me SO much that even ASKING a question like this equals downvotes. Like ""Don't you DARE even ask!!!!!! STOP IT!!!! You're making me CRY!!!!!"" X-D X-D X-D",0
376,“...” (OC),0
377,POLL: Are you satisfied with the game being sliced in parts (even if each part is as a long and complete as a unique game),0
380,"$60 for only up to Midgar has me a bit hesitant.Don't get me wrong, I've played and loved the original, but I feel like they are going to fill part 1 with a lot of filler material that may get repetitive and boring to justify part 1 being a 'full game.' In the original you can compete Midgar in about only 5-6hrs. I'm really curious how they can really expand Midgar only into a 'full length' game. I'm sure we are all familiar with fetch quests that are implemented to essentially add filler material. I hope it's not a lot of that type of material that we're going to get in the remake. 
Something else that concerns me is I hope you cannot mindlessly button mash your way through the game. I've played Devil May Cry 5 and found it to be a button masher that just got repetitive and kinda boring. I really hope FF7R doesn't feel that way.
Also, since the game is going to be in parts, how long would we have to wait for the next part? I hope it's not too long because I feel like some people may lose enthusiasm to pick it up again after a long wait. A huge part of the 'magic' of why ff7 was so good is that we got to play the entire story without having to wait a long time to find out what's coming next. I remember when I finished disc 1 or 2, I just couldn't wait to pop in the next disc to continue and everything was a cohesive whole. I'm not so sure if I should buy part 1 of the remake or just wait until they finish the entire game and buy the complete edition. Since I already completed the original, it's not like I don't already know what's going to happen. In all honesty, I really do hope that FF7R lives up to all the hype it has been getting.",0
381,"Red XIII in promotional adsI know everyone is being like, “Red XIII is not gonna on the first game” “He’s not on the lanyard” and such

But ask yourself, how much can they show scenes of Red XIII without spoiling most of the late part of the storyline?

You get Red XIII pretty far towards the end of the story. So most of his gameplay would showcase battles post Jenova’s escape and Shinra HQ’s facilities

There’s also even a short moment that we were led to believe that Red XIII would attack Aerith. So showing him as a playable character would totally ruin that small scene.

So in terms keeping spoilers to a minimum, situations just don’t cut it to promote Red XIII especially so early on. I’m sure Square is also trying to recreate those same moments for news players. A small teaser would be more appropriate.",0
385,"Midgar’s ScaleSo I’ve been thinking about the scale of Midgar and it’s size. Specifically the upper plate height.
In the original, Jessie says that the upper plate is around 50metres above the slums. In the remake it looks way higher than that, maybe even 10x higher. I mean, they even parachute to the lower plate in the trailer.
I really hope we get to see the scope of the city through panoramic shots and camera angles to get a feel for the scope of the city.

I'm new to the group, so first, my apologies if this isn't allowed or I missed it in my search for the topic. 

I've been thrilled about the FFVII Remake since I first heard of it and my first concern then is my first concern now that we are so close to it's release; which platform to purchase. The last PS system I owned was a 2 which I still have for the original FFVII. Now, I know that it has been confirmed that the game will be released on March 20, 2020 for the PS4, but I'm wondering if a lot of you are in the same conundrum I am; which system to buy. Square Enix is saying just short of confirming that FFVII-R will be released on the PS5 as well as the PS4. But what about all of the other chapters? However many there will be, because we are talking years in between each chapter, will they all get a PS4 release? Is anyone else in this situation, torn between a PS4 and playing now or waiting until November 2020 with a better machine and playing then?

Thoughts, questions, suggestions are all welcome!

Thanks in advance!

396,"FF7R - Red XIIIDo you guys think that Red XIII should have an expanded part in the remake?  


Throughout the original FF7, Red XIII kind of gets shafted till you reach the Canyon. Then after that he gets shafted again. I would like it if in FF7R, he gets a lot more screentime and expanded scenes. Maybe starting here in Part 1 by making him playable for longer or even add more scenes with him. Maybe even be able to take him to explore parts of Midgar instead of having him stuck in the laboratory so you can have more scenes with him in Part 1.",0

421,"My buddy made me a Buster Sword longboardAround 2012, way before any news of a remake was announced, my buddy and I were really in to longboarding at the time. One day we were in a lecture just talking about it and I brought up semi-jokingly how crazy it would be to have a buster sword longboard that you could just strap to your back when your not riding it lol. Clearly this was an outlandish idea, but when I was young I always thought of every and any way you could have something like a buster sword on your back for a functional purpose but there is legit never a reason to have something like that on lol.

Christmas came around that year and our friend group decided to have a Secret Santa. When it was time to receive my gift my buddy came in the room with this long wrapped present and I was taken back by how big the gift was. Opened it up and there it was, my crazy half-baked, semi-joke idea of a longboard Buster Sword. I was absolutely floored. I had no clue my buddy could press longboards or even that he could make them, but he did it. And it looks amazing.

I haven’t ever put trucks/wheels on it so I’ve never ridden it. But I plan to try at some point – tbh I don’t think it would ride very well. But ever since then it’s been up on my wall. Probably one of the coolest, most unique gifts I’ve ever received.

Building something is more fun when what your building is something you like! So, what better than FF7 and my excitement for the remake coming out.

Main functionality is you click a character and it displays some stats. I believe I grabbed these stats off the FF7 original package, where it goes over some brief stats. Haven't added the other main characters yet due to the renders not being out. But when they are, I will.

I learned a ton, it was super hard to build and please don't ask me to build it again! Haha. Anyway, enjoy!

My question is about enemies in the game and whether or not they will respawn. I assume that during certain scripted story missions they will not (for example the first bombing mission). The reason I am wondering is that i love a bit of optional grinding to level up all my party members in the original, and getting enough gil to buy new weapons/armor for all my characters when i arrive at a new hub. It makes me more invested in all the characters (yes even you cait sith). Do any of you have information regarding this? Thanks in advance!",0

But I hope everyone has taken the time to think about what they expect from the game so they’re no disappointed if SE fails to meet their expectations, so just a short list of what I reckon it will be like based on the footage we’ve seen so far:

-The game will most definitely end at the Shinra escape.

-Actual story content is going to clock in at 20-30hrs

-The game is going to be incredible easy and the battle mechanics (although nice) will hardly have any strategy outside of scripted boss fights

-There will be no vehicle exploration of Midgar

-Midgar will have no more sectors to explore than what was in the original and travelling between zones will have monstrous loading screens

-Side-quests are not going to be meaningful 

-Sephiroth will be ham-fisted in at every opportunity 

With that said, still absolutely stoked and it can’t come soon enough!!",0

My knowledge of this series is pretty much none, but I do know Cloud from Smash (Smash got me into Persona 5 also),  I'm wondering if I can enjoy this game as someone who hasn't played this series or is familiar with the lore.",0
471,"The Unused Text Series might provide insight into how the remake will expand MidgarSo I was recently reminded of the excellent [**Final Fantasy VII - The Unused Text Series**](https://thelifestream.net/ffvii-the-original/final-fantasy-vii-the-unused-text-series/).

It's interesting to see how some of the cut / shortened bits of the early game - particularly the [Sector 7 slums](https://thelifestream.net/ffvii-the-original/final-fantasy-vii-the-unused-text-series/part-2/) - line up with what we already know from trailers to be a little different about the remake.

Also, particularly these are things people have expressed some concern about.

I'm not very far through re-reading the series, but a couple of major things have stood out to me already:

## SOLDIER

There is unused text playing up Avalanche's nervousness regarding having to face SOLDIER, and ShinRa escalating their response to the bombings by dispatching SOLDIER.

As the series notes, in the OG the SOLDIER threat kinda fizzles out and turns solely into the relevant backstory bits for Cloud, Zack and Sephiroth. Aside from as regular enemies in a few locations only, SOLDIER aren't really encountered.

As much as I'm not sold on Roche so far from his design and description (quite cringey), the idea of having a legit x-class SOLDIER sent to hound Avalanche and provide recurring boss fights (and possibly even a more meaningful final boss to Midgar) is a great one, and seemingly one that stems from earlier abandoned plans in the OG.


## Sephiroth being introduced / mentioned earlier in the game.

I think some people have been afraid that showing too much Sephiroth too early compared to the OG (brief mentions and the ShinRa HQ segment) is too much of a deviation. But again, there are unused sequences in the game data where Cloud would have had a breakdown in the slums where Sephiroth actually appears before him. This makes me think a little of the trailer appearance where Cloud obviously has a vision of Sephiroth in flames, somewhere in Midgar.

Further unused bits make it clear earlier (i.e. in Midgar) that Cloud remembers/knows things about Nibelheim that Tifa thinks he shouldn't know (and she notices).

Also there is a flashback to Cloud in the van with Sephiroth on the way to Nibelheim that was meant to take place in Midgar, but presumable they decided it was superfluous in addition to the whole Kalm segment.


Anyway, hadn't seen these discussed on here, and thought it provides a bit of a look at how they're using ideas from the OG that they cut from the final release. Hope it might relax people's fears a bit as to some of the changes and new introductions, seeing where they may have come from.",0
477,"Thoughts on the Remake's MusicA thought just occurred to me today. It is known that the first game of the Remake will focus on the Midgar segment of the story, which, compared with the original, will be expanded and added depth to. That being said, the original OST features 85 tracks, 23 of which — if I'm not mistaken — take place in the Midgar segment; that's roughly just a fourth of the outstanding music FFVII has to offer.

Given the scope and length of the Remake, there will almost definitely be new locations to visit (seeing that there has already been an introduction of a new character), so it's logical to assume that there will be new tracks added to the game. Or perhaps various variations of the iconic themes.

So far, the trailers have used familiar tracks; I'm really curious to ""hear"" how music plays out in the final product.",0

First, Nomura said he was actually surprised to find out he was the director a year or two after the initial announcement.

Second, Nomura was involved in KH3 up until a year ago. The current state of ff7R right now is nearly complete, so you can assume that a lot of work was done by the time KH3 was released. Nomura would have had to juggle both projects.

Third, Kitase has been the one presenting the ff7R content at E3 and TGS.

Most of the complaints about FF7 in the past were about the fact that all characters were the same...no unique abilities.


Now SE fixed that giving all the characters unique controls throught their unique abilities allowing the players to create the party they want while keeping in mind that some unique abilities WONT be available to them as they wont be able to have more than 3 characters in their party.

So my question is : Do you think that Materia like Barrier might disappear because Aerith has an unique ability called Lustrous Shield? The same goes for MP absorb with her Soul Drain?

Both options can coexist for sure, but if SE wants to enforce any kind of unique abilities...they kind ofneed to be...UNIQUE no?",0

The only thing extra is the Cloud figurine and the Carbuncle DLC? Or is there more?

That's $250 more dollars for the figurine and a DLC that will undoubtedly be available eventually. Not confirmed but that's what they did with Final Fantasy XIV exclusive pre-order content.

So is it really just the figurine for $250? I would understand someone buying it if they're into collecting those things but it's a lot extra for $250.

Even if the Carbuncle DLC is say, $25, it would still be a lot for a figurine like that, no? I am however a completionist in FF games and I definitely want a physical copy.

So if Square Enix said there's no other way to get the Carbuncle DLC other than from Digital Deluxe or 1st Class, that would be disappointing. I guess then I could technically buy both the physical and deluxe edition, right? Would that work on PS4? It would be around $160.

I just HIGHLY doubt they'd make Carbuncle an entirely exclusive DLC unless I missed something.

638,Anyone on the waitlist for the FF7R 1st Class Edition preorder?I made the mistake of not buying it when it was first announced and now I'm on the waitlist. Has anyone been on the waitlist and been notified that preorders were available again? Or has there been no new updates since?,0
639,I have a theory about why FF7 remake will be episodic.So maybe people have pointed this out before but I do not know if I am the only one to come up with this. So i have thought it was interesting how ff7 remake is coming out just as the ps5 is around the corner. Which makes me seriously wonder(I have no proof or anything of this and maybe someone knows something I do not) but what if they making this game episodic because only the midgar part of the game could actually function on the ps4. So they decided oh lets just focus on the midgar part and then release the rest of the game on the ps5. I am not saying its a bad thing btw if anything it could very well give us an amazing game. As they could seriously create something amazing on the ps5 and if they do it in episodes it could just allow them to create a ton of content and create something truly massive when all episodes are out. (I do think the rest of the game/episodes will come out on ps5 as again the ps4 may not be able to handle what the devs have in mind for ff7 remake after midgar). Does anyone agree with my theory has been pointed out before is there stuff I am missing I am curious what you all think?,0

645,"Will there be outfit changes and will outfits contain stat benefits/perks?I assume there will be options to change outfits similar to XV. I just hope they provide cooler looking stuff than XV... maybe with some special perk for each.

My hopes for outfits for Cloud

1. Advent children (maybe after beating the game)
2. Parka or some fur coat for the snow area (or something similar to what snowboards wear ;)
3. Obviously a Shinra soldier uniform
4. Asian style kimono / samurai gear for Wutai
5. A nice suit for the date with Aerith
6. Probably some cross game promotion like a Assassins creed Viking outfit)
7. Something dope for the end game / North Crater finale.

I left out the cross dressing because that’s most likely going to be an option.

Am still curious to see how they approach the Red XIII sailor suit and am looking forward to laugh my ass off at Barrett being a marshmallow.

Anyone else got any ideas? Or know if they have confirmed any of this?",0
651,"Hope they dont do weapons like they did in adamantoise in FFXVIf you want additional details, obviously the original these weapons were supposed to be massive. The problem I see them running into is there is going to be one specific spot that will be focused because the weapon is too large to really do anything just like Adamantoise. I honestly wouldnt mind a scale down of what they should be just so I can have a full camera view, either that do some type of birds eye view, especially since we fight them in ocean, air and sand.",0
654,"Barret Flashback in Part 1?So I've been watching those Kitase clips on Instagram that they've been posting for a few weeks. But usually when I watched them I was out or at work and just watched with the sound off. Today I went back and watched them with the sound on and I noticed that the music that plays in the background is a remade version of ""Mark of a Traitor"" or the song that plays in Corel. Obviously this song doesn't play in Midgar. But then why would they remake it now? Only thought I had is that maybe there's a Barret flashback at some point. I linked to the post I heard the song in. What do you think?

Also if you search the FF7R Instagram feed there's a video that talks about Tifa's battle mechanics and the music that plays on that post is a remix of the original battle theme that sounds like something that could potentially be used in the fight up the pillar. Link to this one below. Just my two cents.

655,"Thoughts on changes that may be necessary?Less than 90 days left people!  Now that we are closing in on part one, what are some things you guys think will need to be changed in order for events to make more sense realistically?

For example, I feel like the Tiny Bronco sequence will need to be reworked somehow.  It won't make much sense to borrow a small single-seater plane to ferry a party of 6 or 7 to the other continent.  Will they make the Bronco a bigger plane?  Will it be a different type of flying vehicle?

When it comes to the FF7-Remake,not only don't I remember Nobuo-san's name ever being mentioned officially,if you look at the following offical staff list , the music/sound section is not even mentioned.

[https://www.jp.square-enix.com/ffvii\_remake/about/index.html#staff](https://www.jp.square-enix.com/ffvii_remake/about/index.html#staff)

Now I know in all probability that Uemastu is back for the remake...but the silence is nontheless a bit strange don't you think? Amidst all the interview snippets surrounding the game's nostalgia and given by Nomura/Kitase,I would have thought Nobuo would have made an appearance too...or if not him then at least some mention of a different composer?

Uematsu seemed to have had some health issues in the recent past,hopefully he is all better now.",0

At 2:09:00 the guy in red asks the SE staff (she has a blue famitsu shirt) **""We've seen Tifa now, does that mean REDDU 13 will appear next?** 

She replies with **""Well he's in Midgar so.......(specifies) in the remake!""** She then gets asked if Yuffie was gonna be in there as well which she denies (Don't think anyone expected Yuffie anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen some people still in doubts about it and some spreading misinformation that he wouldn't be in the game since he wasn't revealed yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine SE releasing the game in parts but then also leaving out one of the most anticipated main characters from said ""parts"" after being so careful with this remake and trying to make everything as perfect as possible, adding details we couldn't  ever have imagined to be in there.

&amp;#x200B;

People shouldn't expect them to reveal every single character or detail about the game several months before release, they're saving some of the hype.

691,"Character Swapping in CombatIf we assume the full team for part 1 will be Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aerith and Red, do you think there will be in battle character swapping similar to FFX? If we assume you can only have 3 characters on the battlefield at any given time I wonder if it would be possible to have an extra command to swap Aerith out for Red or something like that. I would personally love to see such a system implemented so I don't necessarily have to lock myself in to just 3 party members like I always did with the original. What are your thoughts?",0
693,"Disappointed with how the game is marketed.Just wanted to have my voice heard, because I'm a true fan of the game. I spent countless hours as a child playing it. Picked it up a few times as an adult, didn't forget it, and generally I am very appreciative that it exists.

The first time I heard about this remake, I jumped up and down like crazy. The other people in my workplace thought I was going nuts. And now... I will not buy this.

I remember that as a kid it cost me something like \~40 euro (approximately, since I can't quite remember and it was in drachmas anyways) for what would eventually be hundreds of hours of quality entertainment. Picked the game, put it in the console and was immediately immersed in a new world. No adds, no waiting, didn't have to choose different packages. Pure excellence. But now buying games has turned into a nightmare.

I can not stand it. It' being going on for too long. I want to support the industry. But only if the industry respects me. Stop forcing exclusive DLCs and promotions and ""services"". I would gladly pay double the price I used to, since industry costs have gone up. But make it a fair deal. No gameplay altering exclusives, no way.

If we keep buying it they will keep doing it. We have to play our part. Either they stop it themselves or we take control of the situation. It's a matter of principles. As much as I am begging to play this, I am not throwing my principles away in order to do so.

Here's an example of fighting against this new trend, that happened to me recently.  I preordered RE 2 remake because I was cautiously optimistic based on what I'd seen. When I realized that the preorder exclusives were not just skins but actually different weapons that affect gameplay, I immediately asked and received a full refund. About three months later, they added all the DLCs to the store and the game had a sale. I bought it again. All in all, the company simply lost money from this practice. My patience off and I enjoyed the game in the end.

In a similar fashion, I am not buying FF VII. If they want to add all gameplay related DLC later in a fair price and in a transparent manner, then we 're good. If not, it's their loss.",0

706,"FF7R Deluxe Edition Preorder Debit AttemptsAround on the subreddit I saw many posts about people receiving emails from Sqaure about a debit attempt coming on the 4th of this month. The first email I had received was in the same vein as those who ordered the 1st Class Edition, that this would be one of many attempts and if the funds could not be taken this time around then they would try on another date. I received that email 3 days ago. Earlier this morning, 4:22am Eastern Time, I received a second email from Square saying that the coming 4th would be the *only* debit attempt and if the funds could not be withdrawn then my preorder would be cancelled. Did anyone else here who ordered the Deluxe edition directly from Square receive this email as well, or am I one of the only people that actually ordered this version from directly from them?

Said email read:

*Thank you for your preorder of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - DELUXE EDITION \[PS4\]. We are pleased to announce that we will soon be preparing your order for shipment. As part of this preparation, we will begin charging for preorders on 2019-12-04 09:00 using the payment details that you provided upon checkout.*

*Please verify that you have sufficient funds available for the payment option you selected during the pre-order process. If your payment cannot be charged successfully, then your order will be cancelled.*

Thankfully, even with Black Friday just having past and Christmas coming up I still have the funds for the $91 withdrawl, but I certainly am not the majority.

P.S. Because I know there are assholes on Reddit. Yes, I know Gamestop and Amazon and such have the deluxe edition as well, but I don't have a nearby Gamestop and Amazon doesn't have the greatest track record on fulfilling deluxe editions of games plus UPS sucks ass where I live in the winter so I sucked up the shipping cost to get it via USPS from Square.

I've bought things off of their website with no issues whatsoever, and since this is the remake most of us FF 7 fans anticipated, I'd figure I would go all out and get the 1st Class Edition (I rarely buy CEs, but this is FF 7 we're talking about). I had pre-ordered in advance using PayPal as a payment method since that is how I do all of my online orders. 

However, I get the email saying they are starting charges early in December at the worst possible time and I go to edit my payment method and PayPal isn't listed as an option. Next thing I knew, I check my bank account and see that money was pulled out of my bank account. I clearly had set my pre-order to charge through PayPal (my credit card is linked to that). 

I contact Customer Service and explained the situation, but they told me that I could change the payment method and they called me by a different name (My name isn't Brittany, lmao). ""But, you guys charged my debit card and I specifically didn't want that."" I don't get how they can be so incompentent. I am waiting for a response back from them and hope this gets sorted out.

1. FEATURE - The FFVII Remake commercial has become known as the longest terrestrial TV commercial at 7 minutes long. There is a special edit available on the Square Enix YouTube channel including additional scenes.
2.  Anticipation is growing around the FFVII Remake due to positive reception at the Tokyo Game Show 2019, the first time there has been a stage show and gameplay demo in Japan. Today we are going to look at the visuals for Reno and Rude of the Shinra Company’s Turks, as well as Weapon Growth, Weapon Abilities and other new features of the Remake. 
3. Yellow blossoms on sale from the Flower Girl. Flowers of this type are said to stand for “Reunion”. 
4. An old church on the outskirts of the Sector 5 slums. The building is falling apart; abandoned after a Shinra Rocket crashed into it during a failed launch. One of the few places that flowers will grow in the otherwise desolate slums, Aerith comes to tend to them whenever she can.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  In FFVII Remake, you can improve the strength of your weapons by spending SP to unlock the potential of the Core Materia hidden within. The screenshot to the right is the upgrade screen for Cloud’s Buster Sword. It looks like lots of things are possible, from increasing stats like Attack Power, Magic Power and Max HP, to increasing the number of Materia Slots. Furthermore, each weapon has it’s own unique abilities. Your proficiency with these abilities raises the more you use them, and once your proficiency maxes out, you learn the ability and can use it regardless of what weapon you have equipped. 
2.  With the Materia System you can use all kinds of Magic and Commands by equipping Materia into slots in your weapons and armour. The newly unveiled “Fire” Materia lets you use magic with Fire affinity, evolving from Fire, to Fira, to Firaga. The Independent “Assess” Materia lets you pinpoint the enemy’s characteristics, affinities, weaknesses etc, and press the advantage in battle. 
3.  SUMMONS - If you equip Summon Materia you can call on a Summon during certain battles when the Summon Gauge appears. They fight automatically until the Summon Gauge depletes, or players can use ATB charges to command a Summon to use special abilities. When they disappear they unleash their ultimate ability, dealing massive damage to the enemy. Today we are introducing the super-cute Chocobo &amp; Moogle! 
4.  CHOCOBO &amp; MOOGLE - Riding on his buddy Chocobo, Moogle travels the world. He might look cute, but he shows his enemies no mercy when he drops the “Mog Bomb”! 
5.  ULTIMATE ABILITY - Chocobo &amp; Moogle’s ultimate ability is called ‘Stampede’. They run down the enemy with a herd of chocobos! 
6.  ABILITY - MOG-BOMB! *(Props to kry0sis for this translation!)*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Combat in the Remake uses RPG style commands as a base, with Action style elements blended in. Pressing the square button marked ‘Attack’ will perform a regular attack, pressing repeatedly will link into a combo, and holding down square will unleash an area based attack. On top of that, pressing triangle allows you to use a character’s unique ability. Let’s have a look at Cloud’s.
2.  Cloud’s unique triangle move is the ability to change between the more balanced ‘Operator Mode’ and the more aggressive ‘Punisher Mode’. Once in Punisher Mode, movements become less responsive, but ‘Attack’ changes to ‘Strong Attack’ and deals more damage. 
3. 'Attack' in Operator Mode changes to ‘Strong Attack’ in Punisher Mode. It looks like sacrificing speed for stronger attacks leaves you vulnerable to taking damage yourself. 
4. ENJOY THE ORIGINAL COMMAND SYSTEM OF FFVII THROUGH CLASSIC MODE - In addition to Easy and Normal game modes, there is also a Classic Mode. Players can battle in just the same way as in the Original, but with revamped graphics. Characters perform actions and fill their ATB gauges automatically, while the player simply chooses whether to spend those charges on Magic, Abilities, Items etc. What’s more, you have the option to take control of your characters back at any time just by using the controller. You can even change between any game modes at any time.
5.  THE NEW ‘REMADE’ BATTLE SYSTEM EXPLAINED 
6.  BLADE BURST - A ranged attack that unleashes a magical beam from your sword.
7.  TRIPLE SLASH - Cuts enemies in the surrounding area for three successive hits. Your efficiency increases by attacking multiple enemies.
8. ALL THOSE MINIGAMES ARE ALSO GETTING A REMAKE! - One of the biggest charms of FFVII was the huge variety of minigames. In this new version they have been given the ‘Remake’ treatment too, with new minigames being included alongside the nostalgic classics.
9.  It wasn’t in the original, but you can now play darts using the board in Seventh Heaven. 
10. The Motorbike chase looks incredible! The scene where you are being pursued by Shinra looks great and fun to play. You get to ride alongside Jessie no less!

1. Originally released on the PlayStation, FFVII is being remade using realistic modern day graphics techniques. But it’s not just the game - the character artwork released alongside it is also being remade. Today we are introducing Aerith and Barret’s character artwork from the Remake. In addition, we’ll look at the Sector 5 Slums as an example of the revamped locations, and reintroduce ourselves to the members of AVALANCHE as presented by their voice actors.
2.  THE WORLD OF FFVII REIMAGINED 
3.  LOCATION - AERITH’S HOUSE - A tiny cottage tucked away in a corner of the Sector 5 Slums. Aerith and her mother Elmyra live here together. They grow a variety of flowers in the garden, which Aerith sells to the people of Midgar every day.
4.  The crystal clear water flowing down the mountainside and the quaint buildings in the background make for a beautiful scene you wouldn’t expect to find in the slums.

I was so shocked to see it. I was talking to the shop assistant about it. There's nothing in-store yet. But like I said the other day, I think I heard an advertisement on the FAMILY MART convenience store radio last week. This receipt is from ""7-11"" store. There are 3 (ish) MAJOR convenience stores in Japan (like, every 100 yards). So now I saw advertisement in 2 of them (I seldom go in the 3rd, Lawsons).

719,"Red XIII abilitiesI've seen a lot of people talk about how Red will attack, or how his weapons work canonically, or where the materia will be stored in his clips, but nobody seems to talk about what his abilities might be. 

He's a character who's got well rounded stats, and can really go any direction.

The mobile games have a thing about making him a buffing/supporting character with things like Lunatic High or Howling moon, which works well because of his Red Mage-esque role in the original, but also it seems like a waste to not have him be a physical attacker due to how fun/different it is to play as a beast, and it's not like he's a bad physical attacker anyways.

I want to see what others think we could be seeing in the remake, buffing howls? Somebody once mentioned him possibly clinging onto larger enemies like he did in Advent Children and gnawing at them doing damage over time, or possibly pinning/trapping an enemy as an immobilizer? Or will he just end up sled fanging around into people at mach speed like in the original? They have a lot of options with this character and I'm interested to see where they take it",0

I guess a better question is: do you guys think the experience on the PS5 will be worth waiting the extra 8 months, especially after factoring in the future installments of the game?

I should add that I'm pretty busy and will probably not use the console for anything other than to play through the FF7 remake. I have a Xbox one from years ago that just sits in my closet and collects dust.",0

728,"Wutai in the remakeSomething that has always seemed a bit silly to me (although obviously forgivable) in the original ff7 was the idea of the war between Shinra and Wutai. 

Shinra has an army, huge robots and other mad technology and weapons.

Wutai is a village, with 5 warriors guarding a pagoda and that’s pretty much it.

If there was a war between these it would last 30 seconds (and I’m being generous to Wutai there).

So what if, in the remake, Wutai was a huge city/state in itself, to rival Midgar. Except maybe it’s ff7’s USSR to Shinra/Midgar’s USA. A rival power in the world but second place in that respect. And post war it’s become all run down and miserable.

It would add to the believability for this situation - although it’d create a problem for the developers having to create another huge city and fill it with content.

I do wonder what the world map will be like in the remake. 

Surely it’s not going to be one big city and then just a handful of small villages on the whole world like the original? Or will the world be expanded with more cities and much bigger towns for realism?

Has there been any word from official channels on this? And what does everyone think?",0

736,"First Game I’ve Preordered In 5 Years...Hype Is Real But The Concern For The Subsequent Entries Is TooFavorite game of all time. The first RPG is FF series and this game was my first exposure to a more serious game back in ‘98.  I love the attention to detail and marketing this game is getting - My only fear I guess you can say is if Square is prepared to release the next entry in 2-3 years and have the Game entirely finished before PS5 bows out. 

They haven’t been up to SquareSoft’s ability to put games out since becoming S. Enix",0

756,"How will our progress be transferred over? And a ""HOT TAKE"" predictionNot sure if this was covered but I feel like if we can get an answer as to how or if our progress in part one will transfer over to part 2 that will give us an idea on how part 2 and other chapters will be given to us.

I know that it has been said that each part will be its own stand alone game BUT it would be a complete waste of time collecting the materia, gaining the skills, equipment etc. only to lose it in a new game. I feel like there is a strong possibility that these new chapters will be given to us in DLC form. When I look at how other games have used DLC in order to reinvent itself over the past few years I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. For example Destiny's expansion packs, Rainbow Six Siege and their new seasons with operators and new levels etc.

When I look at what we have been given as far as trailers, box art, gameplay etc. from a marketing standpoint it just does not seem feasible.

* As Square releases new chapters they would only be catering to a set audience. The only consumers open to buying part 2 would have to have already played part 1.
* If a consumer purchased part 2 before part 1 what equipment, materia etc. would they be given? What level would they start with?

As far as the release time frame, I'm calling it now, we will get a new chapter once every year. The DLC size will be huge and cost us roughly $30 each.

I could be wrong here but as I mentioned before I'm going off of feasibility as well as what we've seen done so far with other AAA titles and DLC. Thoughts?",0

763,"Negative Nancy moments.So, we are all enjoying  FFVII remakes news so far, and why not: the game looks good, reports of the demo are positive and it feels like the game is poised to deliver on a pretty big demand. Regardless of how each of us feel about hype, I think it is safe to say that the majority of the fans of the original game have a bunch of good will towards this game.

But of course, nothing is perfect, and there is no reason to expect FFVII remake to be as well, but instead of the major criticism people have brought up already, what would be your minor gripes you have about this game judging by what we know so far?

No need to go full blown of hate (I mean, if you want to, go ahead), but I'm curious to know what made people go ""humm, I don't know about this"" whenever reading about this upcoming game.

Myself, no difficulty mode harder than normal. of course they can unlock a harder one in new game plus, but from what people said so far, the game is too easy, and for a action orientated game to be easy can be a major downer, and if there is a hard mode to be unlocked, it still is a bummer to have to play 40+ hours for this.",0

Basically all it is, is normal mode, but the X button that lets you go into slow mo has a time limit. This would help make it close to the original. In the original there was ATB, but as you were going through the menus, the opponent had an opportunity to attack you.

• They seem to be gearing up for something major soon, the screenshot dump, the interviews with key staff members, the upcoming Famitsu article, the Animate deal, the snippets of a long interview with Kitase, etc..

• December 3rd is the 25th anniversary of the release of the original Playstation so I wouldn't be surprised if there are some announcements to celebrate the day and FF7R is the next major PS4 exclusive.

•December 3rd is also the date of the Playstation awards which it seems like Sony are going to put more focus on this year as it seems it will also be streaming in English this year.

I've thoroughly enjoyed reading your thoughts on the matter and I'm glad we can discuss this openly without this post being down-voted to hell. Cheers. 

The trend of visual effects and/or realism in games today takes away the imaginative faculty.

That is not to say this direction is necessarily bad. However there is something in the brain that gets excited when it gets to make the connection for itself, instead of having it spoon fed. This is similar to when you read a book vs watching a movie.

The original FF7 game lacked facial expressions, voice acting, body language, and high resolution imagery. But that is not to say it wasn't there when we experienced the game. Instead these aspects manifested inside our own imagination, filling in the void with our own unique interpretation and experience which is what gave the title a lasting impression. I believe this is why a lot of fans have a personal connection to the(se) game when we first touched it; It was our imagined world.

Fast forward to today, these aspects of the characters/world are now filled-in given current generation technology. Our brains have also completed development and our ability to allow for divergent imagination deteriorate as we fill our heads with dogma and belief systems.  This leaves us little room for imagination, and this is part of the reason for why often remakes suffer backlash, which would give rise to the debates as to why some think &lt;insert character/element&gt; should look, sound, act, and why something is not ""canon"" etc etc. These elements which have been built over the years in your imagination has set a certain foundation and expectation for the remake, and anything that deviates from YOUR ""imagined"" experience from the original will completely shatter this foundation. For these reasons I believe SE attempting to recreate nostalgia in FF7 is very dangerous and unwise.",0

My thought is a liberty Square Enix could take with the series.

But, the original intent from the creators was to kill Barrett, but decided Aerith would be a more emotionally devastating decision.  It would be interesting to see if the person who eats a sword is the one you take for a ride on the gondola in the Golden Saucer.  The one you earn karma points with.

936,"Reasons i am now hyped for this game - Great game design decisions I can seeOriginally, I was expecting to be incredibly disappointed.  After watching the trailers and gameplay, my expected disappointment has turned to hype.

Heres why

Character Banter -

My expectation was for this non-existant and it was an unexpected surprise.   Getting the interactions between characters during boss fights is great.  The boss fights seem a bit long, but it's nice that we can get some added character development during the fights. It just adds a cool layer which makes it seem more like a movie and really helps meld the action gameplay with the RPG genre.

Nice Job!

Character Switching -

I was originally disappointed with the concept of swapping characters and only controlling a single person at a time.  What happens a lot in this types of games is that you find one person you are comfortable with, and play only with them, and not bother swapping.

This is speculation.  But it seems as if they are forcing player swaps based on characters strengths and enemy weaknesses.  This is clear in the demo when they talk about long-range vs melee.  It would be great if they added at least a few more ways to force us, the player, to swap characters.  

We also get Aeris's limit, which forces you to move players to the circle on the ground.  Interesting concept that falls inline with the idea of forcing the player to really utilize each characters specialties. 

The way magic weaknesses work also seems to indicate that magic oriented characters (like aeris) will be more valuable for specific fights.   

So - we have Cloud - melee high damage, Barret - Long range - shoot at things flying or on walls, Aeris, magic oriented - deal high damage, etc.

So with this, the devs have the ability to swap enemy weaknesses throughout a fight which encourages players to jump around to different characters throughout the fight to be truly efficient.

Nice Job!

Mini Games

I assumed mini-games would be toned down. But it seems as if they aren't forgetting any, and, of course, improving them.  What this tells me is that we might get fleshed out towns with actual Role Playing elements.  For years now, SE's MO has been to put players into a town, and have them run around aimlessly in a linear town with a singular, mostly linear purpose.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vREzGQsh038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vREzGQsh038) (ff12 imperial city archades - a great example of how to build the worst town experience ever)

If we go back to the Wall Market - it was an amazing ROLE PLAYING experience because the town is lived in and we get to experience it as someone wandering around.  There were tons of people, all with something to say, which helped immerse you into the world. 

My worry with the remake was that the experience in Wall Market would be neutered.  But seeing the mini games makes be think they will be pulling much of what made that section of the game special into the remake.  I hope they add to it, and definitely hope they change a bit of the process of getting the dress around though.

Nice Job!",0

939,"I got to play the FF7R Demo... Here are my thoughts on itThe video link is my full 20min long ""what I thought"" and details regarding the demo experience:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQLcH5UikeE&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQLcH5UikeE&amp;t)

But for the purpose of the thread, here is The York Notes version...

* The gameplay is very much akin to that of a Yakuza game, there's many similarities in terms of being able to use attacks outside of enemy encounters to break open objects, environmental context attacks, the boss structure. If you've played any recent Yakuza games or to a very lessen extent Shenmue, you'll likely be familiar with the gameplay when exploring a dungeon.
* You can defeat enemies using environmental hazards, when I fought against the security in the reactor, it was possible to knock them off the platforms resulting in an instant kill. Assuming other dungeons/areas will have similar effects.
* There were 30 pods set up for the demo, I was in the 2nd group, I noticed the bulk on people in group 1 and my group all reached the boss at around the same time, after around 5min of gameplay... but for the majority of people, it took between 10-15 min and some took the full 20min in order to defeat the boss.
* Magic effects are really cool, like if you use the ice magic you can see ice crystals form on the target and it the enemies react as you'd expect them to depending on the magic effect.
* When you switch between characters, the Ai will use special moves and abilities on the character you leave control of, it won't default to standard attacks, it will also take cover. It will not use limit breaks and I didn't notice it using any magics.
* Chaining attacks is amazingly cool. Say you're controlling Cloud and you select an ability, you can then instantly switch to another character, select an ability or magic attack to perform. When you switch out of the menu and time begins to run at normal speed, both the characters will perform the attacks at around the same time which can result in some devastating attacks and effects.
* The only major negative I had was that it's very hard to keep track of HP an MP per character, whilst there is an onscreen display, it's so tucked away that it's one of those UI icons that you don't pay much attention to because your focus is drawn to the bulk of the action on screen.

If anyone has any additional questions as to what I thought, by all means ask on either the vid or here and I'll do my best to reply.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Should say, I do go over more details in the video such as how combat functions and how you can hit multiple enemies using standard attacks, so if you're interested in more, please check out the vid.",0

I reckon local co-op wouldn't be very useful outside of fights. But there should be some way to make this interesting even during explorations ?

What about an online mode ? What could be the concept of such a mode for FF7 ?

Does SE ever said something about these ?

SE surprised us already with a few unexpected tweaks and ideas. Such as the classic mode. What if they have more in stock ?

I'm personally very interested in playing co-op. That would be a great addition.

957,"Surely there must be significantly more content once you aquire Red XIII? [Mild Spoilers]Apologies of this has been posted before but just a thought.

In the original Red XIII joins the party 90% the way through the Midgar section, surely this can't be the same for the remake. 

I think barring any significant story changes we can safely assume Red XIII joins the party at the same point in the Shinra building. As this is being sold as a full FF game, he must have his own Limits to learn and weapons to aquire, I can't see this all coming from the remainder the Shinra building and the escape. On top of this he is one of only 5 (that we know of) playable characters, and while I am by no means a developer must have been a challenge to create. If I was a dev I would want to show him off.

I know the remake will have much more content than the original, but given Red has not been revealed, we likely have not seen much of this. 
Perhaps the party don't leave Midgar so quickly after escaping from the Shinra Building this time round..",0

961,"What to expect for those intending to play the FF7R demo at EGX 2019 in LondonSo I just got back from the first day of EGX 2019 which just so happens to have FF7R demo kiosks. 

The FF7R section is a portion of the Playstation booth, its kinda small with only 30 kiosks for the demo to play on. Its in the first hall just after the ticket hall and queuing area so you'll need to be quick to get in line. The wait from the end of the line is supposedly 1 hour. It was a bit longer for me because they had technical issues and lost power to about half the kiosks. Fortunately they got them back up after about 20 minutes.

Next to the queue area is another small queue to get your picture taken while holding the Buster Sword. It's fairly weighty at 7KG! I was a bit disappointed that the Shinra propaganda video that Jessie hijacks was not present here for show. You go straight to a kiosk after queuing up. 

As for the demo itself, its still just the E3 demo we have seen before, no surprises there. However it is the English demo running with Japanese VO which I thought was an odd choice. In any case its very fun to play and looks great (despite definitely being an older build, the aliasing on Cloud's hair was super noticeable and seems to be much better in newer trailers). 

The Thursday crowd levels were pretty manageable, only the major AAA games had queues more than 30 minutes long, lots of smaller titles were either walk up and play or wait for the person in front of you to finish. I suspect this may change come the weekend though. 

To anyone going over the next few days. I hope you have fun and that the wait times aren't too long!",0

Do our characters get reset? I honestly rather have all of the editions together than separated in different games but im open to seeing how they do it.

And fighting weapons, im guessing we will have to wait for the final game to come out for this? And building my character in this game is going to help me for the super bosses in the last game? hmmm

977,"(Speculation) How the game should be split.Ok I know there's already tons of posts like these, but I just finished replaying the original again, and now I have a great idea how the game could best be split up. Obviously this is my personal opinion, but I think I could be on to something,

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1: Midgar

So  the entirety of the game takes place in an expanded Midgar, or so we've been told. However, I wouldn't be surprised if they snuck Kalm in the end, and the Sephiroth flashback. (Can you imagine being able to play with Seph in the party with you during this part?) I think it's likely this is in the first game, because we've seen Sephiroth show up in the trailers, and they would need to explain the deal with him and Cloud's backstory to first time players, who they are also marketing towards. It would be weird playing a whole game with no real knowledge of who the main character is. Also, just as they did in the original, this would be an awesome sneak peak at end-game level content and powers, to tease what's to come in the later installments.

Part 2: Open world (Kalm- to Whirlwind Maze)

This is what excites me. If the first game will take place in one city, then the next game has the opportunity to feel completely fresh by being treated as an open-world adventure game. This hypes me up thinking how they could use this approach and give us plenty more to explore throughout the first areas of Disc 1. But i don't think they should end it right after the Aerith scene. That's too short of content for an entire game, imo. I think they should just go a little further and have the second game go until they reach the Whirlwind maze, where Seph/the Weapons awaken, and they lose Cloud.

Part 3: Final Acts (Mideel to Norther Crater)

Imagine starting the third game without Cloud! That would be really interesting and give you an opportunity to get more experience with the rest of the cast. Also this would feel like a great starting point because, Meteor will be summoned, and the Weapons will be present, making the game feel like something new. The journey to get Cloud back could be a really awesome chapter that will make players  feel like they need to earn his return, especially after maining him for 2 games and losing him, I can see getting him back feeling very rewarding! Everything from here on will take us to the end of the game, which isn't all too much story-wise, but will give space for all the great endgame content like battle arena, and secret bosses.

* **What is Final Fantasy XV?**

Final Fantasy XV (Japanese: ファイナルファンタジーXV; Simplified Chinese: 最终幻想15; Traditional Chinese: 最終幻想XV; stylized FINAL FANTASY XV; Final Fantasy 15 in some regions; abbreviated FFXV and FF15), the fifteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, follows Prince Noctis of Lucis and his three friends who must save the world of Eos by defeating the Niflheim Empire and purging darkness the plagues the ""star"" (another name for world).

Due to the scale of the game's narrative, the Final Fantasy XV project was split into several multi-media parts, dubbed the Final Fantasy XV Universe, to increase awareness of the game to different audiences.

* **Should I play Final Fantasy XV?**

The answer to this question is ultimately up to you. What some consider “good” might be others’ “bad,” and vice versa.

The game’s strengths lie in:

* the layered characterization.
* the themes of friendship, brotherhood, and accepting your duty with grace.
* the attention to “little things.”
* the freedom of choice in combat and exploration.
* the graphics.

However, some criticism includes:

* the implicit storytelling and unexplained events.
* the amount of research required to completely understand the story.
* the simplistic depictions of war, politics, and revenge.
* the linear final third of the game.
* the lack of forced difficulty.

We strongly recommend you form your own opinion!

* **What are all the pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The confirmed pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe are the works in the following table.

Feature-length Games|Mobile-only Games|Demos|Downloadable Content|Featured Audiovisual|Trailers

Pieces that are not confirmed to be part of the Final Fantasy XV Universe include Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn -Prologue-; Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn; and Final Fantasy XV: The Dawn of the Future.

* **Do I need to play the DLCs, experience all of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, or play other Final Fantasy games?**

The DLCs and the Final Fantasy XV Universe is entirely optional. According to Tabata, their purpose is for a player to “get a better view of the world where the game is set.”  While each part of the Final Fantasy XV Universe is optional, “some fans who only see one part might be left with a negative impression, or like they've missed crucial parts of the tale.” You can play Final Fantasy XV without playing the DLCs or experiencing the Final Fantasy XV Universe, but you will need to pay more attention to context clues.

You do not need to play other Final Fantasy games in order to understand Final Fantasy XV. Each “numbered” Final Fantasy does not share a storyline with another. At most, playing other Final Fantasy games allow you to notice references and recurring themes.

* **What is the best order to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The crucial pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, besides the main game itself, and other pieces are listed below. They are listed in the order in which they were released and include the approximate time they take place in the “timeline” (see “Which parts are ‘canon’?”). Use this information to determine when is the best time to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe and related media.

1. Platinum Demo — 12 year before the beginning of the game.
2. Brotherhood — 15, 12, 8, and 5 years before the start of the game, and Chapters 1 through 3.
3. Kingsglaive — less than a year before the start of the game to the start of the game.
4. Prologue ~Parting Ways~ — the day before the start of the game.
5. Episode Gladiolus — during Chapter 7.
6. Episode Prompto — during Chapters 12 and 13.
7. Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades — between Chapters 13 and 14 and, for Future quests, Chapter 14.
8. Episode Ignis — during Chapters 9, 13, 14, and the end of the game.
9. Royal Pack — adds content throughout the entire game.
10. Episode Ardyn -Prologue- — &gt;!2,000!&lt; years before the beginning of the game and Chapter 14.
11. Episode Ardyn — &gt;!2,000!&lt;, &gt;!35!&lt;, and &gt;!22!&lt; years before and Chapter 14.

* **What are the upcoming DLC and updates for Final Fantasy XV?**

Development for Final Fantasy XV ended on March 25, 2019, with the release of Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn. The other three planned Dawn of the Future DLC—Episode Aranea, Episode Lunafreya, and Episode Noctis—have been canceled. However, a novelization of the Dawn of the Future DLC was released in Japan on April 25, 2019, and an English version will be coming *no earlier* than Fall 2019.

There are no updates planned for the main game or Final Fantasy XV Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades because development has been ceased. However, there may still be small updates to the executable files. (This is not the same as a bug fix.)

* **What's up with the different versions of Comrades? Can I still get the Comrades DLC version trophies?**

Initially, Comrades was released as a DLC expansion launched through Final Fantasy XV called Multiplayer Expansion: Comrades. As of patch 1.27, the DLC expansion was moved to a standalone launcher on consoles called Multiplayer: Comrades. The PC version is the only platform that does not have a standalone launcher for Comrades.

After patch 1.27 on consoles, the DLC expansion's trophies are no longer obtainable. Furthermore, any trophies earned and any saves created on the DLC expansion will be transferred to the standalone version, although trophies may not activate until you unlock certain parts of the game. Finally, players can still access the DLC version to view previous photos and create characters for the &gt;!Chapter 14 cameo!&lt;; you cannot play missions on the DLC version.

* **Which version of Final Fantasy XV should I buy?**

Final Fantasy XV was released in many different editions. Please use [this table in our Wiki to view the differences between each edition’s content](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/console#wiki_difference_between_editions).

As a rule of thumb:

* If you do not have a copy of Final Fantasy XV, you should buy the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition for the PS4 or XB1 and the Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition for PC. These editions are a bundle of all of the 2016 to 2018 content; the 2019 content (Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn) has not been released as a cost-effective bundle.
* If you do have a copy of Final Fantasy XV for PS4 or XB1, wish to keep playing on PS4 or XB1, do not want the “bonus items”, and the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition is not on sale, it’s more cost-effective to buy the DLC individually.
* If you are considering whether to buy the Windows Edition, keep in mind that it is meant for high-end computers. Use the demo and benchmark tool to determine whether your system will run Final Fantasy XV to your satisfaction. Beware of late-game spoilers in the trailer at the end of the demo!
* Consider buying the game on sale. The base game and its bundles are often on sale for around 50% off.
* If you are buying a *used copy* Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition, make sure it comes with working codes. The DLC is not included on the disc.
* On console, the DLC region needs to match the base game region.

* **My game’s not working! How do I fix it?**

4,"Need Help, Think i have a Datalog Bug!!I have recently come back to playing XV (on PS4), to finish getting some trophies i never managed to do on my playthrough, i know i was trying to get the Datalog Trophy when i was last playing, i got about 55 entries in it.

I decided to go for this trophy first, so i hunted down some guides and went looking for my missing entries for Almanic and Omega files, the only problem is, i go to the actual locations, and nothing is there, nothing to interact with at all. 

I watched literal clips on YouTube of where the items are located and I'm standing right where they should be, and nothing appears. 

Anyone know of a way around this?",1

11,"""APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS"" Lyrics and Meaning~Salvete omnes!

I have, via contact with some Final Fantasy Distant Worlds folk, obtained the choral score to ""APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS"", and importantly, the lyrics. While they are in Latin, are really interesting, and written one who has studied ancient Roman culture and language. There is A LOT of specific religious imagery and allusions. At this time, I cannot provide a smooth translation (I should actually be studying for the Latin exam I have coming up...), but I will soon! And in the meantime, I'll post the lyrics, and my thoughts on what I gathered from site reading them.

&amp;#x200B;

**-During the Intro-**

Specie tua, tantum carnem adme omnes habet cultum

Ego sum qui mittit petras et gubernat omnes vitae.

Coelum\*, Terra, aversione. Magna, parvus, reversusque.

Fortis ductor, praecipio Quod ligabis lucem vobis.

**-Verse, after string melody-**

Cum omnibus lucis plenus, Apocalypse finibus

Victum unus qui comedit, Hic vitae omnia; tenebris

**-During oboe solo, choir is quiet-**

Malum incarnatus surgit, Adducentes secum mortem.

Para! Para! PARA! PARA!

**-After the Key Change, the women and men sing this next part in stretto (offset from each other)-**

Fortis Rex, Bellator, in manus gladio Bellum in virtute,

Victum quod hostibus. Para!

**-After the strings' and piano descending scale in octaves | More stretto between the women and men-**

Magis mortem venit primum. Quod est quidam venire.

Para omnes! Para omnes! Para omnes! *(the women sing ""Para omnes"" on offbeats while the men sing ""Para"" thrice across the whole stanza)*

**-Final stanza, the Big Finale-**

Nunc est tempus, Haec est locus Ubi nos obstandum, omne tandem ex nobis.

Unum! Omnes!

***-BIG G IN THE LOW BRASS AND STRINGS-***

\*Coelum is an alternate spelling of Caelum, which means sky/heaven. In Medieval Latin (which again, this is), that's the common spelling. It also helps to avoid confusing it with the Caelum family. In this case, coelum is  indeed just heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, we are being told the King, the True King, is the highest of them all. Both Heaven and Earth avert (Coelum, Terra, aversione) their gazes from him. He shines plenty of light, he's got a sword, he's really powerful, nothing compares. His arrival is the end. The Astrals (my interpretation) are telling you to prepare yourself (Para!) for the coming of True King. And once you've done that, go tell everyone else to prepare (Para omnes!). I'm not saying that the True King is God, since the writers stopped short of calling him that in the lyrics, but there is certainly a fair of... comparison to be made with a certain other ""King of Kings"".

Anyways, I'll update this post with a translation as soon as I can! If anyone else wants to tackle it, please by all means! Hope y'all can find some fun things in this!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I can't believe I didn't even translate the title. While it's probably obvious, I'll do it anyways. Says ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" or ""Noctis's Apocalypse"". I personally would go with the first one, since while Latin doesn't distinguish between something like ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" and ""Noctis's Apocalypse"" in the genitive case like we would in English, the first one I find fits better aesthetically. But either would be an acceptable translation.",1

I tried pressing L3+R3 , I tried spammin them and I tried holding them but it didn’t work... am I missing something? Or do you think it’s because I had the normal version of the game?

39,"Finally starting playing the dlc... Prompto!So, Gladio was meh. I dont really like his controls. And that extra final trial? No thank you. I have relied on potions, and I only get three? However, I was amused how his combat reminded me more of games like dmc or onimusha. The health bar not refilling and more emphasis on survival. I just enjoy being able to prepare...

However, I just got to prompto and... am I only one who thinks this is a fun change of pace?

Like, I actually enjoyed Dirge of Cerberus. I wont deny its faults. But it was still fun. This feels like a more involved version of that.

I love the different weapons, strategies, and how he just plays. I wouldnt actually mind a whole game like this.

Plus he naturally regains health and so it's more like a third person shooter rpg. I would love to see a game where you get to steal weapons, add them to your arsenal. Gotta collect ammo, but keep it sort of scarce. Or instead of stealing the weapon a second time, if they hold the same weapon you have equipped you simply get ammo for it. The  something like resonance of fate where you can customize the guns. Rpg like. 

I feel square is sitting on something that could truly be amazing. Prompto is also the only character of the four who had a background. A past full of darkness and mystery (they failed to really explore...). And I just love the goofball. So maybe seeing him after the events of the main game having to deal with a new threat would be awesome.

Anyone else feel like i do?",1

46,"Questions about Versus XIII (Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC spoilers!)I didn't know whether to post here or to the KH subreddit, but I figured that this place would have more people that are aware of the development process of Versus XIII which later on turned out to be FFXV. I've been googling a lot of things and since I'm not familiar as to what happened in the long development process, I was hoping that someone could give me some answers or just correct me if (when) I get some things wrong. I'll try and make a TLDR at the bottom. 

So to summarize, the KH3 Re:Mind DLC (spoilers) had a (actually two) secret ending which basically recreated a VXIII trailers opening frames. It has Yozora (character strongly resembling Noctis) waking up in a car. There are lots of comparison videos online, if you want to check it out. But basically that and earlier references to VsXIII and FFXV have been interpreted by lots of people as a sign that Nomura is 'salty' about losing Versus XIII and that he will make it (versus) no matter what. Now I'm here not to discuss as to whether or not Nomura will try to recreate the project, but I'm here to ask why Nomura would be salty. 

I'll now write something based on things I've read and how I've experienced them. Correct me if I'm wrong during any of this. VsXIII was revealed in 2006 with a cinematic trailer and as the years progressed more and more trailers came, but no actual release dates/signs of the game being close to release. I've understood that there's been also development hell surrounding the project, with lots of troubles regarding game engines (?) etc. The game was later renamed (don't know what's the correct word here) to FFXV in 2013, and Nomura was removed (?) in 2014. Then Square said that 

&gt;This move allows Tetsuya Nomura to focus his full efforts as the director of other highly anticipated titles, including Kingdom Hearts III

So Nomura had been working on a title for 8 years, and according to Tabata the game had been 20-25% complete before it became FFXV. So clearly not nearly ready and Nomura had to move on to other projects, like KH3 which was already highly anticipated at the time. This is where my question as to why Nomura is or even would be salty? He had a lot of time to develop the game and although a lot of the roadblocks weren't created/caused by him, he had to have understood that it was time to move on. Also I feel like FFXV pretty much did justice to Versus XIII and things that Nomura had created. This is just based off of my personal gameplay experience of FFXV and watching Versus trailers but the two seem to have had a lot of similiar ideas and themes. Surely some differences (Stella vs Lunafreya, Fabula Nova Crystalis) but that would be inevitable when you consider a creative process that span upon over 10 years. But even in the very first trailer of versus there are things that carried over to FFXV. From my point of view it seems like XV respected the ideas/groundwork that Nomura had laid out for Versus. For gods sake Nomura's name is the only one that you see on the title screen. So do you think that Nomura feels like he's been unjustifiably removed from Versus XIII and that square took away his dream project?

As for another note now that I've gotten excited about the future of KH, I've stumbled into a lot lot of comment sections praising Versus and bashing XV. That just seems like the biggest circlejerk I've probably ever seen. Like how can you love a game that you never got to play, that you've mostly just seen pre-rendered gameplay and trailers. It wasn't even a complete game and nobody knew what the story would be, but I've seen people saying things like 'Stella was the perfect antagonist' and 'it was everything I liked in a video game'. Like how can someone say such things and be serious? To me it seems like VsXIII is something that a lot of people have created their own unique versions in their head, and now have collectively decided that it was an amazing game. When it really wasn't even a complete game.

But yeah I'd appreciate it if anybody wants to share their thoughts about these things with me and answer some of the things I've yet to understand. Also feel free to correct me if I stated something obviously wrong, I'm a little hazy about the facts since I'm completely new to FF as a whole. Hope that this was managable to read, since English isn't my first language. 


TLDR: With certain parts of KH3 having many similarities with Versus XIII/FFXV people now say that Nomura is salty about 'losing' Versus XIII. Is this the case, and has Nomura got any reason to be salty?",1

52,"about Yozora, i'm starting to think..that maybe Versus 13 was initially intended to be Versus Kingdom Hearts... people seem to think Nomura created Yozora and that whole thing out of pettiness for having lost FFXV and Noctis, but i think this was his plan all along..but for Noctis

the first versus trailer came out in 2006, just one year after KH2! and if i remember correctly back around that time it was being compared alot to KH, and looking back at that trailer now it does feel more like KH than FF..but with blood :P

so my theory is that Nomura wanted to use that unnamed protagonist (that later became Noctis) in his own series that would run parallel to KH and then eventually cross over in KH3.. like KH but without disney and really dark..heck, maybe OG Noctis kingdom was in the realm of darkness!

but square was going in hard with the FNC so it ended up there as versus 13, and then later became FFXV..and when he basically lost custody of Noct he couldn't/ didn't want to go through with his original idea..delaying KH3..

but now he's doing it with new characters.. im curious to see where he's going with this.. i love FFXV, its probably my favorite game of all times, but i wouldn't mind seeing Nomura's original vision come to life in the KH univers.. but then again, Yozora is cool and all but he ain't no Noct..

the more i think about this the more clues and similarities i see

a while back i made a [theory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/comments/ds2ncr/a_theory_on_what_happend_with_xvs_story_cuts/) about how i think the moon was gonna play a part in the FFXV story but was cut late in production leading to the story feeling wonky in some parts.. i was gonna make a follow up with a theory about how the moon would have played in but i never got around to it

i think the moon would have played much the same roll as Etro's gate would have in the original concept, collecting the souls of the dead, ~~it would probably also have been closely connected to Luna lol.~~ if that was the case it would make sense for Ardyn to spread the starscourge to turn people in to daemons so that our protagonists would kill them and fuel the moon, until something.

now, replace the moon with kingdom hearts, Ardyn with Xehanort, and the daemons with heartless and you basically have a twist on the KH basic concept!

at first i was like ""this is too much like KH, it can't be right, Nomura wouldn't create 2 stories that similar""but now with the Yozora stuff im starting to think there might be something to this and that he created the Versus world to be a dark parallel to KH, with a similar but darker story and without disney.

basically sora= realm of light, OG Noctis= realm of darkness, and they are connected by the realm of dreams!  back in the day Noctis whole deal was that he slept alot :P and Sora sure does alot of dreaming! nomura has said that Noct and Sora are complete opposites in many ways, but there are alot connecting the 2 of them!

nothing is either good or bad, only thinking makes it so

I don't think the legacy of FFXV/Versus X-III is over quite yet, seems like Nomura has more to say on it. I did a more thorough write up on how Noctis may tie into the Kingdom Hearts series. https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/etk0x0/discussion_2_quick_theories_after_remind_spoilers/ The first theory shows how a Kingdom Hearts character appears in the Re:Mind trailer, while the second tries to tackle how we see Yozora/Noctis utilized, and how we may see him utilized in the future.",1

61,"The Best Story BossI like the later chapters of the game in spite of some serious criticism but to me the last and greatest story boss in FFXV was Leviathan.

[https://youtu.be/g\_CmnODCQA0](https://youtu.be/g_CmnODCQA0)

[https://youtu.be/w7y3XNIdGVQ](https://youtu.be/w7y3XNIdGVQ)

The fight receives so much hype and build. There's a lot of tension and drama and intrigue with the Empire and Luna and Ardyn and Ravus and of course our heroes all being there.  Leviathan proves to be quite...willful and it's up to Noct to prove himself to this goddess.

The music is some of the best in the game - which is saying something.

The visuals are amazing for both phases.

Noct is overcome with a mix of anguish and fury and desperation and we can feel that, too.

I don't think any of these factors were in such perfect alignment in any other fight. It's equal parts emotional and awesome and just plain fun.

Daemon Ravus had potential but there's so much happening at that point that our heroes are kind of on emotional overload (as are we) so we can't really spare him as much feeling as we did our heroes in the Leviathan fight.",1

87,"A thank you to Final Fantasy XVI'm really not one to pour my heart out online but I thought I'd post this. Hopefully no one makes fun of me, haha.  

A year ago today I was introduced to the Final Fantasy series, for the first time, by my brother. At the time I was going through some heavy depression after several stressful events in my life. I was pretty much at my lowest point and needed something to do while I was recovering from a small injury (nothing major) and a really bad common cold. 

So my brother downloaded some games on Steam for me and we started Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition. Again, I had never played a Final Fantasy game nor any RPGs, either. I had zero expectations. I didn't know about Versus XIII or the controversy surrounding the game. I was just excited for something new to focus on.  

I could could go on about how much fun I had while playing the game but I'll keep it short and sweet. I  *loved* the music, which is what stood out to me first. Valse Di Fantastica/Sunset Waltz, Noctis and Stand By Me are songs that I still hum constantly. I really appreciated the focus on friendship/brotherhood and loved the four main characters. I grew so attached to them actually that when I was accidentally spoiled about &gt;!Noctis' fate I forced myself to believe it wouldn't happen and when it finally did, I was heartbroken but satisfied with the ending. !&lt; Noctis and Prompto are both characters who I could really relate with and the relationship between the four reminded me of what friends I do have, as well as my brother. Not only that, but the theme of living on even after the death of a loved one is something that resonated with me deeply. 

It didn't take me very long to beat the game, about three weeks of playing every day and after school, but in that time I started to feel happier and still, I find it silly that a video game is what helped me through such a slump.

Today I see a lot of people say video games are bad for you, and I think this stigma is slowly fading but as an addition FFXV didn't keep me inside, it inspired me to do the things I thought were the most fun in-game, besides, riding giant birds. 

I kept pursuing my passion for photography, I decided for the first time, ""Why not go camping?"" and ended up going and loving it. I started hiking and going fishing with my dad which he was surprised by. I got into Florence + The Machine and after a year of an art block, I started drawing again. 

Now, video games are just another hobby of mine like the ones above. Final Fantasy XV introduced me into the series as a whole, I ended up playing FFX last summer and I'm very excited for the FFVII remake. I also ended up playing some other RPGs, because of the amazing in-game voice actors, which I never would have thought of doing before. 

I was going through a lot of hardship last year but in short Final Fantasy is just one thing that helped me move on. 

**TLDR:** Final Fantasy XV got me through a really bad depression and I thought I'd share why I love this game. I hope for anyone whose shared my experiences, video games have helped you too.",1

I have finished the Angler's Nightmare quest (and i double-checked the completed quests list to be sure) some time ago.

The strange thing is when i fished at that specific location (where i caught Murk Grouper before for the quest), I saw a Murk Grouper mingle with the small fish. And i fished it out. Then after waiting in the camp nearby for the next morning, i found another Murk Grouper. 
Is it normal? I thought the Murk Grouper you caught for the Angler's Nightmare quest was the one and only Murk Grouper in the game. And after that you should be able to see the large blue dot representing the Dread Grouper taking its place. Somehow for me the Murk Grouper still lingers and Dread Grouper won't show up at all.",1

116,"i absolutely loved ffxv...even though i cried a lil bit *SPOILERS*i just finished my first play through of the game, and i’m in love with it. i am by no means a video game connoisseur, but i can say that i really enjoyed it. i even cried like a baby at the end of the story. the gameplay, the storyline, the graphics, the combat, the weapons, and everything was amazing. i felt like i was part of the group. i ended up getting emotionally attached to the characters by the end of the story. i can say that this is the first game i’ve played that i’ve really connected  and engaged with. 

a couple things made sense to me after the story ended, like the logo. when you first load into the game, there’s a weird looking logo that has no relevance to the game whatsoever. until the final scene. when i realized that the logo was a picture of noctis and lady lunefraya sitting on the throne, i cried that much harder. in chapter 9, i think, sid drove noctis and his team to altissia via boat. he then said to trust in your friends, and never doubt them. the whole storyline highlighted the friendship between noctis and the others, forming a truly unbreakable bond that the player could relate to. i realized that when noctis was floating in space, defeating aldyn, ehat his friends were beside him. his friends must have fought the giants and died, coming to stand beside noctis even in death. they were with noctis, even till the very end(and then some). again, this made me cry even harder.  the significance of the pictures that prompto took throughout the story shone through. looking back through all the journeys and memories to find a photo, i started to cry. i wasn’t ready for the story to be over so soon, and i was attached to these characters. there was also other stuff that clicked after the game, but that would take be another couple pages to explain lmao 

i may be a baby for crying at this game. however, the character development that took place over the course of the game rendered me useless to being stone-faced. now, i’m gonna go back in time and go through all the side quests. thank you to all the creators of this story who made it truly connectable and engaging.",1

119,"Not a lot of games can make you cry like this one.Bruh.   


I am late to the party, it took me a long time to get XV for PC and even longer to play it, and then even longer to complete it. 

Honestly I've hated this game for the first half of the game, it's obviously a ""first try"" for the FF series in a lot of the things it does, the Open World aspect can be weird, the combat is sometimes sluggish and sometimes on point, the enemies just kinda stand there while you hammer on them and then attack you without feedback or anything.

The game isn't perfect, at all. But one thing always stood out to me: the relationship between the four main characters, every time I camped, every time we talked, every time they would come up with random quips at each other, or compliment each other's combat, it all was very unique for a game, so I stood around to see where the story went.

But that finale. That finale hit me so hard, from the moment you pick your picture from the ones you saved, to Regi dealing the final blow, the final camp scene. 

I cried like a baby through it all, I loved every moment of it, I can say that this game's journey was worth it, through all the ups and downs the boys were always there, and in the end it's because of their relationship that this game was elevated from being a game that I only wanted to ""get over with"" to see the story, to one of my favorite stories in recent JRPGs, to the point of wanting to find stories like it.

I finished the game in 2017 with about 117 hours. I hit max level with all characters (120) and stopped playing around the time Comrades came out. I finished some of the post game dungeons (missing e.g. Costlemark tower) and still have some hunts to do.
I killed Naglfar and a high level mark on a military base (can’t remember the name).
I also finished Pitioss.

And doing that Magitek rush, if it's with your storyline Noctis, would be interesting.  Too bad it requires Stadia.

171,"For a first time FF player this game was a beautiful experienceI know I'm late to the party but I just played through FFXV Royal Edition, which I got earlier this week. Finished the main story and I liked it very much.

 The story is almost archetypal and in a way very simple, with parallels and almost stereotypical characters. But what made me like the game more, was how the relationships were built. I jumped into the game without watching any movies or reading any backstories, and I loved the way I just immediately was a part of this group of friends. They interacted with each other quite naturally and I truly felt their struggles and emotions, especially at the end. 

The carelessnes of the beginning turned quickly into a more serious quest, and at the end everything started to go downhill pretty fast. The game created a false sense of security with it's slow start and that's why I think every tragedy, fight and interaction between the guys felt more real towards the end. 

As I have read some online forums after completing the game, I've found people complaining over the convoluted and complicated plot, which makes me glad that I didn't dive into the lore too much. I didn't care about some plotholes that there may have been, because to me the story was rather simplistic in its core. So I might have a completely different perspective to this game, than some other fans who have spent hours upon hours catching up with the games lore, and that's fine to me. Great thing about literature, paintings, games, music or any kinds of art is that we can enjoy and interpret them subjectively. 

Of course this wasn't the worlds best game, that's obvious. But it's what I was searching for right now. Combat was interactive and fun, exploration was simple but rewarding, side quests or hunts didn't feel completely useless. The world was beautiful and diverse, and the story+characters were good. 

I don't really know as to why I wrote this, this game just really was the right game at the right time for me. I guess I just wanted to appreciate the good things that it did. After some time I'll probably dive more into the side content, altough right know going back to the camping and hunting wouldn't probably feel quite right. 

Altough this was a great experience I probably wont buy other FF games since the turn based combat is a major turn off for me. Also as far as I know they are quite different from this one aswell, altough as I've now gotten to know, they seem to be much more liked by the FF community, or atleast not as divisive.

Also sorry if some things seem unclear, I'm trying to work on conveying my thoughts in English.",1

There's only one problem - I have no Datalog (in spite of having a fully updated version of the game), and there seems to be no way to unlock it.

I went to the barrel in Hammerhead where there's one entry, there was nothing there. There was a Cosmogony book in Galdin Quay I could read, but it did not add any categories.

215,"New FFXV Mobile Scenario &amp; Gameplay Announced# [Promotional Image](https://i.imgur.com/MWUSqv4.png).

Korean developer [JSC Games](http://www.jscgames.com/) have announced today (via various news outlets, such as the [FNTimes](http://www.fntimes.com/html/view.php?ud=202001071305554049ee0209bd21_18), and [CSTimes](http://www.cstimes.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=326269)) that they are jointly developing the *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* (tentative name) with [GAEA](https://www.gaea.com/) and [Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group](https://www.opg.cn/cn/), based upon Square-Enix's *FINAL FANTASY XV*. The game will also be published by Shanghai Oriental Pearl for the Chinese market.^1

The new game has a few differences to the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* previously released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and most recently for Microsoft Windows. 

The story is set within another world parallel to the world of *FINAL FANTASY XV* and begins immediately after Prince Noctis and his retinue begin their journey. Players will become the protagonist and travel the world with friends in order to save it from various threats. Other new content will be included, such as the previously existing world map being expanded upon with new areas such as continents floating in the sky. 

Unlike the gameplay of original release of *FINAL FANTASY XV*, the new mobile game has been characterized as the following: 

&gt; * The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is being developed as a large-scale MMORPG using the Unreal Engine 4.
&gt; 
&gt; * They aim to go beyond the single-player scope of combat present in the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* by providing a variety of battles for players to cooperate with other players to complete.
&gt; 
&gt; * Gameplay involves simple touch controls.

Park Ji-young, CEO of JSC Games said, “The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is a game with an immersive story, fascinating characters, and it captures the unique sensibility of a Japanese RPG. We are committed to doing our best to bring both the action and graphics of the console experience to mobile.”

Additionally, a trailer will be released during the first half of this year, but an exact date has yet to be confirmed. 

No release date or comprehensive information about what regions the game will be released in has been announced.

From Ravatogh (the furthest west you can go in Lucis) to the gates of Insomnia (the furthest east you can go in Lucius), it’s listed as almost 7 miles. But you can spend almost/an entire in-game day doing that drive. It definitely wouldn’t take a day to drive 7 miles, especially if you drive as Noct and look at the dash, you can see they usually are going a decent speed. In the anime, it seems like Lestallum and Cape Caem are a few days apart, when you can do it in one day in the game (though the anime and game don’t always line up 100%.)

I am running the game on 1920x1080 and with texture quality High, everything else is Low or disabled. I will say right away that at times, I was playing on everything high and everything low, kind of flip-flopping between them because I didn't know when the issue was still there or not, it occurs either way and here it is:

My game

1. crashes randomly for no apparent reason
2. runs perfectly at 60 FPS but in certain fights (I tried Naglfar just now and it crashed) the FPS drop down to like 10 for a few seconds before recovering, with struggling to do so.
3. Sometimes nothing really happens (the chocobros running or standing around, doesn't really matter) and the FPS drop down to 1 for a full second before going back to 60.

So I had these issues in the past already, around release of the PC version, and I tried asking people about it. People told me to use this ""Virtual Memory"" option that creates a pagefile.sys (It is 16 GB big right now, probably filled up while I was playing before it eventually crashed today) I enabled it and the issue seemed resolved.
Apparently it was because of a RAM leak?

But as I continued the game the issues just came back for no apparent reason. The memory leak issue kind of vanished for people and some of my friends even said that ""it was fixed"", but I don't seem to have any changes and my game crashes/lags still as much as it did on release.

When asking on reddit or people in the FFXV Discord people were like ""well, I speedrun the game and have no issue. It must be your system of some sort.""

Today I tried playing it again and was enjoying myself for about an hour or two until it just crashed again. I REALLY want to know why this is still going on for me and I can't wrap my head around it. Is my system outdated? I can play many other games just fine, including games that are newer. I don't know if its just the PC port having issues or my system at this point, really.

The real kicker for me was when my friend told me that he had ZERO issues playing the game: never crashed for him, never lagged for him. Constant 60 FPS without any trouble, smoothest experience ever, and his system is actually weaker. He had a GTX 960 (at the time) 12 gigabytes of RAM and Windows 7. He was running it on an HDD too. I just don't understand how he never had to deal with this stuff but I do.

So, does anybody have any idea what I can do or where I should start? I am just absolutely clueless now.",1

263,"One More Trophy to GoSo for my holiday break I’ve finally come back to FFXV for all the DLC trophies that got added after the fact.  I got the two Update trophies fairly easily, then got through Gladiolus, Prompto (those freaking snowmobiles), and Ignis (friendly match bleh).  Finally finished up the Royal Edition trophy’s (Omega Weapon ONLY took an hour and a half).  This morning I booted up episode Ardyn hoping I could knock everything out in one shot...only to get an A rating instead of an A+.  So looks like I ha e one more play through on easy, then I’m officially done with FFXV.  I’m excited to finally do all the extra stuff, but I can’t lie and say I’m a little said to finish my second journey with the Chocobros.  I loved the game the first time through, and it’s been even better the second time.  I definitely feel like XV is going to go down as underrated.  I haven't enjoyed a Final Fantasy game this much since FFX, and I’ll never be able to hear Stand By Me the same way again.",1

Hoping someone can help me troubleshoot, so this is what happens on my system whenever I try fighting these monstrosities. Look at my temps and GPU/CPU usage when the stutters occur. I have tried basically any settings and this keeps happening seemingly randomly as some times (as you can see in video 1) everything is fine but some other times the power point mode turns on.

333,"Regarding removing unwanted DLC and add-ons – how to play the game in a preferred wayI have an issue with my recently bought Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition from PS Store.

I enjoyed the original vanilla experience years ago, somewhat.

I was very psyched about getting a chance to play the game with all of its DLC episodes and new performance updates on PS4.

As usual the PS4 UI would ask upon download which of the many (+20) said DLC items I would like to install. Unfortunately, I was not aware the game would install some of the said add-ons in the Royal Edition without my consent. This includes unwanted DLC such as ""Item: Travel Set"", ""Item: Gourmand Set"", ""Item: Angler Set"", ""Booster Pack"" and ""Booster Pack+"", all of which I absolutely do not want to interfere with my gameplay experience.

The worst offenders being probably the Travel Set which cuts 50% off from all in-game hostel prices and fuel and somesuch ""travel expenses."" I have no intention to make the game any easier for me than it already was. If anything I'd prefer a way to make it more challenging.

This is supposed to be ""optional content"", but right now – for me – I can not find a way to get rid of said content.

I have tried deleting and reinstalling the game now countless times. I only seem to be able to control the installation of the larger DLC episodes, but not any of the previously mentioned files.

I've been in contact with my regional PlayStation customer support but they are not offering me any help to fix the license issue.

As far as I know, my PSN profile and thus the game is now forever tainted with said add-ons that cannot be undone if I wish to play the game in the latest 1.29.

If only I had bought all the wanted DLC individually **one by one** and perhaps I could've evaded this issue.

Has anyone found a solution of playing with certain wanted DLC only?",1

341,"Big FPS drop to 17 FPS locked in combat, until I wait a minute and it goes back to 70 FPS?Hi guys, just got back in the game after buying my new rig. It's running fairly smooth at 70 FPS on Ultra with Pure Light shaders, but sometimes I'll just enter a battle and it bogs down the game to 17-18 FPS and stays there, regardless of me pausing, alt-tabbing or killing every enemy. It just jumps staight from 70 to 17 FPS, and it takes about a minute before it climbs back up super-fast to 70 FPS.

It's not like I see my system dropping a couple of frames when a lot of stuff is happening on screen. It literally jumps from 70 to 17 instantly, and locks itself to that framerate. Luckily, it happens only a couple times per game session, but it's really bothering me.

What exactly is causing this to happen? I am hovering fairly close to my 8GB vRAM all the time, around 7.5GB, but my monitoring software doesn't record it breaking the 8GB, so I'm not sure that's the issue.

SETTINGS:

\- 1440p resolution, 120fps in settings

\- All Ultra, with VXAO off, lighting High instead of Very High, and Filtering to Low

\- ReShade with Pure Light preset (I tried toggling it off and on when the bug happens, and I stay locked at 17-18fps. It's not ReShade or a hardware performance issue....)

\- EDIT: I tried setting TRAM to High instead of Highest and that didn't fix the problem.

343,"Returning to FFXV, questions about Royal Edition and playthroughIve done so much searching on this topic my head is starting to spin and I couldn't really get the answers that I was looking for. My story, like many others, I completed the game and now am in Chapter 15 doing random stuff (2 dungeon keys left and Pitoss). Completed all other quests up to this point, have all the fish, all the dishes, all the hunts. So I've tried to do almost everything.  


Well, I now decided to buy the Royal Edition and have the dilemma that so many have asked about. How do I go play the new chapter 14. My understanding is that I have a few options but all of them have negative, please correct me if I'm wrong:  


1 - start a NG+ and play everything from scratch  
2 - use chapter select to start from chapter 14 and again I lose progress on a lot of stuff that Ive just recently completed in chapter 15  
3 - start the chapter 14 intro quest from chapter 15 but then miss out on loot, boss fight, cut scenes etc.  


Couple questions :  


A - if I do a NG+ or chapter select (my understanding these work the same way), will my list of fish caught, recipes all still be there?  
B - I think I might be looking at this issue all wrong with wanting to have everything on 1 save when in fact thats not really necessary. At the end of the day whats the lesser of 3 evils above? I've heard some say, do a chapter select, play the new chapter 14. Once done, go back to your ""main save"" and then go back and do chapter 14 again. This way you see the stuff from the chapter select that you'll miss but then your main save will have that stuff all completed as well.  


Does B above make the most sense with my thinking? Am I crazy in wanting to have 1 save that has all the stuff done on it? lol",1

Normally I get A+/As in Time and Finesse, and a perfect card every-so-often. And this is even with taking several minutes on mobs and constantly having to spam healing.

Ever since I hit 50 Ive been getting Ds and Cs on both, even when I quickly (less than a minute) finish a group almost exclusively with Parries and Link-Strikes.

So given that I meet/exceed the same performance criteria (and my overall performance just *looks* better), I was wondering if theres been any discussion or confirmation that level, or differences in level, effects the standards to which battles are graded.

364,"Episode Duscae, can i still buy it with Type-0?Hi everyone. I know it's weird that someone still wants to play Episode Duscae now that we have the complete game and its Royal Edition. It's just that when Episode Duscae came out with Type-0 i didn't have my console, and i never played it until the full game came out. But FFXV is my favorite game, it's very special for me and i really want to play that older version in Episode Duscae. It's like a frustrated dream, haha. 
So, i read that you can still buy a Day One Edition of Type-0 that comes with the code for Episode Duscae. Someone knows if is this true and where can i buy it? Thank you!",1

\*Disclaimer: The Episode DLCs tend to have spoilers for the ending, so if it's your first time playing I'd definitely move those to the end.

\*\* Note: Dawn of the Future doesn't have an english version available yet. I just put it at the end based on what I read the story will be about.

Final thoughts: I haven't played since 2017. Back then my opinion was that this was a really good FF game, but suffered due to some terrible pacing and story telling in the back half. Obviously, the ending was as good as any in a game even back then in spite of the lacking second half. My opinion after replaying with all the content is that the story is as good as any other FF story as a whole, but is really held back by the fact that it's spread across entertainment mediums and requires making a guide on which order it should be experienced in. If Square Enix would've just cut the spoilers from the episode DLCs, inserted little prompts to play them in the right spot, and found a way to work the rest of this content into the actual game (e.g. replacing the opening cutscene with the omen trailer), then FFXV would go toe-to-toe with the greats in the series.

My PS4 got stolen along with the physical hard CD of the game after I beat FFXV and only one of the downloadable DLCs (episodes).

So obviously I don't wanna play through the whole game again, but I do wanna play all the episodes and the royal pack expansion.

They said they were working a fix on it but far as I know nothing has came out yet.

I don't expect an answer, just kind of expressing my thoughts. I'm a completionist so this bothers me a lot however I don't want to do them offline by deleting updates. Hopefully and rightfully they should make it so if you have the trophies in the standalone you automatically get them in the DLC version which would make sense. They did the exact same thing but vice versa.

Anyways your thoughts? Not many people probably care like me unless you're a trophy hunter etc. If you do care I recommend calling and sending an email to encourage them to do it!",1

414,"Why had the Oracle to heal Noctis as a child instead of the crystal? (Spoiler for Ep. Ignis V2)I'm writing a fanfic and I started wondering why, after the daemon attack in Noct's childhood, he had to be taken to Tenebrae to be healed by Queen Sylva (this is assuming his injury was from the accident itself and that the daemon didn't infect him with any Daemon Juice ™, it's been a while since I saw both Brotherhood and Kingsglaive). But in Episode Ignis V2, Noct is able to save Ignis' life AND restore his eyesight with the crystal's power. If the crystal is that powerful, why couldn't Regis heal Noct himself using the crystal? 

Now, I get that Ep Iggy V2 isn't canon at all, and that FFXV generally has quite a number of plotholes (I say this with all the love in my heart, I adore this game), but I was wondering if anyone else has any thoughts about this, maybe an interpretation or a possible explanation?

431,"After all this time, Im willing to give FFXV another shot.When I first experienced, as well as a lot of other people, I felt that FFXV was just missing the point of which it was trying to convey to its audience. Things felt disjointed, and apparently rushed as you progressed through the game, and though with the initial playthrough, I barely picked it up again after completing it for the first and final time. Since the release of Royal Edition, which I have downloaded, I always wondered about going back. I heard there was a decent amount of stuff added but I questioned whether or not it was worth it. Since it left a terrible taste in my mouth throughout all this time and with all the cut content that was taken away from the game since release, I always had this disappointment with Square. Though I can't blame Tabata on trying to get this game out and actually doing so. It's not that I hate the team that worked diligently on making ends meet but rather Square's upper management that ROYALLY screwed over this game. A crafted piece of art that could have been more but as a result became nothing more than a shadow to its light side.   


Alas, I have given it some thought and so I thought I would reach out and ask the community on this. Should I give the game another go? I am hoping that it can change my mind on what I initially thought about it years ago.",1

The video below is of another one of the quests, which I actually ended up completing after restarting the game. This time, however, it seems the chances of it not glitching out are nil. Must have been a fluke the last time I beat a quest there. Also, when I leave EXINERIS it starts me out underneath Lestallum. Like literally underneath the city, looking up at it. I know they're just hunts, but I'd really like to complete them. My OCD is spinning mud right now.

I just finished the Menace Dungeons and I hadn’t swapped Gladio’s weapon  that does Holy damage for something else. Dang, it’s my fault he’s healing.  Equipped new gear and worked out some strats to bring him down.

But back on track, I got the game, loved it, platinum-ed it. I got the dlcs and played chapter prompto and gladio but by the time ignis chapter came out I was already engrossed in other games and ended up never playing it.

Plus some of the reviews and things people had to say about this game didn't encourage me to play it at all. Regardless I picked it up on release day and played it quite a bit. The open world stuff was fun but the game couldn't hook me like I wanted it to. The story didn't grab me at all. 

I recently picked it up again and finished chapter 9. Finally the game grabbed me and I ended up finishing the rest of the chapters over the past week. This is instantly a classic Final Fantasy for me now. People seemed to not like it once the open world closed off and the story became more focused but that's exactly what I wanted. Even Chapter 13 that everyone seems to hate I really enjoyed. It was frustrating but it made sense with the story and how I was playing it. Final Fantasy has always been about the journey for me.

478,"Is there a character that left an impression on you?I first apologise if another member has make a thread like this one or if this not an interesting topic, I only want to see what other avid players feel on the characters.

Which character from the Final Fantasy XV world has made a memorable impression on you? The answers can be from the main characters to the supporting/minor characters (e.g. Cor, Iris, Talcott, Sania Yeagre, Kenny Crow). I favor more than one character, though I list my top three:

* **Regis**, as I sympathize for the onerous weight on his shoulders. From losing his wife Aulea, to raising Noctis alone while defending Insomnia and the citizens. Seeing Regis do what he could to protect Noctis, the people of Insomnia, to Clarus in the battle against Glauca. I have pondered if Regis was ever informed who Ardyn truly was before his death and what Somnus has done to his brother.
* **Ardyn** is to me a sadistic and troglodyte character for abandoning his humanity to hurt people and Noctis who did not wrong him, though the story from Episode Ardyn and the notes from Dawn of the Future helps provide an explanation on why Ardyn is malicious toward the Caelum household. He suffered greatly to be forced in a fate that felt like a great deception, to heal the infected by absorbing the starscourge to being rejected by the Crystal and later told by Bahamut that his role was to shroud Eos in darkness. If I remember correctly Ardyn did not ever learn whether or not Aera was informed what was going to happen to him or whether Somnus knew of Ardyn's fate, so being left with unanswered questions placed a heavy sadness on the character.
* **Noctis** story is a tragic journey he was burdened with, as his fate to give his life for Eos was a cruel preordained decision from the Crystal. Each chapter in the game leading to the final battle was immersive to me and the many interesting people Noctis and his friends encountered were intriguing or amusing. The war with Nifelheim (and Ravus watching cautiously over his sister) was preventing Lunafreya and Noctis to see each other was hurtful, and I did sympathize with the pain Luna and Noctis felt. The only time the two can be together was in the mist of the battle, and that time was only brief and chaotic, no time for the couple to breathe. The bond with Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto and the obstacles that challenged their will and strength was a good example of brotherhood and friendship.",1

I do have some questions (really only one...) about how I can get the “best” experience out of a game that didn’t seem to be completed until two years after initial release.

Oh and I should mention this is my first time playing the game.

1. Does the Royal Pack add any new cutscenes that weren’t included with the free patches?
2. Is Royal Pack worth the extra $15 (and does this dlc ever go on sale????) to get the “best” ending, better combat system (that Unleashed feature thingy), etc?

I’m curious to know if I am missing out on anything that truly improves on the original game before getting to the last dungeon (which, as I understand, is the biggest selling point of this re-release).

So when Noctis is collecting the Royal Arms, each one disappears because it’s added to his arsenal. Makes sense. But I’m confused about a few things relating to this. If each royal arm disappears after collecting its power, then how have previous kings collected them? Like say how Regis has all 13 arms, but how did he get them if they disappeared when the king before him got them? Or do they only disappear when Noct collects them? If that’s the case, then why!? Also, in the beginning of the game after the first royal tomb, Noct asks Cor how many royal tombs there are. He said there’s only 13 left, but they don’t know the locations of all of them. How do they not know all 13 locations if each king before Noct has collected them?

This got me thinking; when running FFXV on non-Asian PS4s the Jump and Confirm actions are mapped to the same button ( X ), whereas the Jump and Confirm actions are mapped to two different buttons on Asian PS4s ( Jump to X, Confirm to Circle ).

If Asian PS4 owners swapped the O and X buttons' functions through the PS4 OS, does this garble FFXV's Jumping and Confirming the same way it does on non-Asian PS4s?

2) At the end of Chapter 2 there was a cut-scene of Insomnia under attack. The cut-scene had 0 dialogue and 0 explanation for what was happening

3) After trying to reach Insomnia, I got a call from some random person named Col who told me to go back to Hammerhead

4) When I reached Hammerhad I was directed to talk to Cid. Cid says one sentence that went something like ""It was a ruse to get the crystal and the ring"" without further explanation of what those things were and why it was important.

I personally think that it would have gotten released in 2018 or at the very least this year.

I don't know if I'm supposed to just ignore them, or keep track of them in battle, or what.

676,"About to rebuy. Questions about which version to get.My PS4 copy was stolen about a year ago and I'm really itching to replay. I have a PS4 Pro hooked up to a 4k tv with HDR (FF15 was actually why I upgraded to the pro) and I remember the performance was actually pretty respectable apart from the frame pacing. 

Conversely, my PC currently has a GTX 970 with 8gb ram hooked up to a 1440p monitor. I feel like the trade-off would be slightly better performance for the sake of a fairly noticable drop in image quality, especially for playing in 1440p where I'd likely have to lower some settings. I'm not a super techy guy, but does that sound about right?

I'm trying to play with Japanese VA and Spanish text/subtitles. Is that doable with both versions?

Is there any kind of mod scene for the PC version that might tip the scales toward that version?

I remember when the game first came out, the combat kind of threw me off. I was expecting a proper action-style combat system instead of the hold-the-button-down-to-countinously-attack thing. Did they ever add an option to turn off the auto-attacking and dodging?

It's  ニックス・ウリック in Japanese (something like ""nikkusu urikku""). In the Kingslaive movie in English, they definitely pronounce it ""Ulric"" with that ""L"" in there, so it's what the team decided was the way to say it. BUT, reading the katakana out in Japanese, that ""L"" sound added in the English reading isn't really there.  

I think the original intent was to connect Nyx to [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk), the famous walled city from the Epic of [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh). The wall is a Big Deal in Gilgamesh, and also in Kingslaive. Add that to the name pronunciation in Japanese and it's at least food for thought. What say you?",1

755,"PC version: Xbox interaction and DLSSThis is both for the sake of providing information where it is apparently lacking, and to request confirmation in order to address an issue that is apparently unanswered.

**Microsoft Store &amp; Xbox One**

If you are of the extreme minority who own the game on Xbox One and buy an additional copy for PC on the Microsoft Store, you will find that game saves are shared between the two. Of more interesting benefit is that you can share saves regardless of what DLC you have purchased on Xbox One; despite the PC version coming with all DLC sans Episode Ardyn, progress on the PC version's DLC is gracefully and seamlessly ignored on this save data if you skip back to playing on Xbone without having purchased the requisite DLC. This is very good to know for the extreme minority of people like me who keep multiple versions of the game (personally, PS4 Pro at 1.00/no DLC for best day one experience, Xbox One X with all DLC except Royal for best vanilla experience, PC with ALL the things) and take issue with the horrible state of the Steam version.

**PC in General**

767,"Question about Armiger WarpstrikeFrom all my time in the game, i've noticed Armiger Warpstrike is 100% legit trash.

It takes pretty long. But the damage is absolutely pathetic. Meanwhile just ""holding O"" in Armiger will do WAY and i mean WAY more damage and it will also gapclose way faster. There is no reason to use Armiger Warpstrike over ""holding O"" while in Armiger mode as far as i know.

This seems to be because Armiger Warpstrike is always only a 1.0x damage multiplier.

However… In the clip i posted below. For some reason. I suddenly get a proper Warpstrike 2.4x Multiplier while in Armiger. And my target actually dies in one hit... The Second target gets the typical 1.0x and doesn't die in one hit... again proving how bad Armiger Warpstrike really is.

In the second clip, i'm pretty far away from the target yet only get a 1.0x multiplier.

I feel like Armiger Warpstrike would actually be useful and damaging if it would get the proper multiplier based on distance. But it doesn't… So it sux.

But my question is. Why am i actually getting a multiplier in that first clip? What's the trick? What am i missing? 

https://plays.tv/video/5db8a4d61a3b5d7918

PS: if you don't believe Armiger Warpstrike is trash, notice in the second clip i only shave off 10% of a trooper's HP but then i hold O for like half a second and already do 40% HP on another target...

774,"Prompto's Best Handgun?I know this hasn't been too much of a debate singe the FFXIV event dropped, giving us the new handgun, Abandon of the Vortex, and it's good and all, but I think his best handgun is really debatable. Between Abandon of the Vortex and Death Penalty, the power difference, including strength bonus, is 6 towards Abandon of the Vortex, a very small number. It gets an increased appendage breaking advantage, which is a small niche. Otherwise, the +50% vulnerable damage is nice, but given the AI of this game, I find it won't be too useful too often. On the other hand, Death Penalty has a 1% chance to inflict Instant Death, which certainly is a small chance. But for similar damage when given the Critical Hit food (sushi), I think that Death Penalty is likely easily far better when against enemies that are susceptible to Instant Death. But when not susceptible, or when not using the Critical Hit food (sushi), it goes back to Abandon of the Vortex. 

I know this is a very small, niche topic to discuss when it's for the Handgun, used by a character that, when you control, isn't going to be using the Handgun much at all, but since I've seen people claim that Abandon of the Vortex is Prompto's best Handgun, I just thought I'd give my input.

Just wanted to share my observations from a person who has never played any FF games or even been exposed to it.  I am considered at least middle age and I have never enjoyed single player RPG's before, tried many including fallout etc.

I have to say, this one is different.  I have owned it since release, played it maybe 10 minutes on release and just shelved it (windows version)  I have been playing it the last few days and it's really been a joy.

1. The scale and scope of the detailed world is astonishing.  I am a software developer and have been over 30 years.  The level of work in this thing is just amazing to me. 

2. The interactions and story and work among the group is fun and doesn't get old or tired.  So many RPG's and JRPG's that I have tried are repetitive and annoying.  They mix it up well and make it fun and you end up caring about the story and the characters in your group and frankly I have a terrible imagination and still loved it.

3. The depth of the game, I am on chapter 3 but I have gone back to 1 and 2 areas and had fun and am level 21 already because I wanted to do more there with customizing the car and other things.

Just a really fun experience for a guy that has not had much enjoyment with single player RPG's in the past.  I'd highly recommend more than a cursory glance if you are like me and just never really liked them.

Take care!",1

832,"FFXV - My experience so farWell, in a couple of words: The most buggy game I have ever installed on my PC.

I am actually typing this while I wait for Windows 10 to finish installing onto my USB pen drive to fully format my PC.  
I have constant grey screen crashes, black screen crashes, and just out of the blue normal crash to desktop crashes.

For crying out loud, I'm having crashes every 2 minutes of starting a load...   
I've tried DDUing my GPU drivers (in safe mode ofc.); reinstalling the GPU drivers; turning off Ansel - I literally deleted the gods damned folder from the drive to be sure -; forced windows to update (I always set it up to only download updated after the maximum amount of time, like 6 months or something; Tried borderless window, fullscreen, even windowed mode  both on the .ini file and ingame; max settings and low settings; all nvidia shit on AND off; V sync on and off...

I give up. No other game has been this frustrating to me. The annoying part is that I was actually having fun - But for some reason ever since I reached Zegnautus this has become unbearable...

...

BRB, formating this piece of shit windows...

/em looks at watch

10:40pm.

This is going to be a loooong night...

If anyone has any tips about making the game run without crashing... let me know.

Not sure I want to invest more time into this game when there are significantly more interesting games in my backlog.

I was mixed on this game to begin with, got to Chapter 13 and feel like dropping the game. I'll probably push through and finish the awful main story at least though, assuming it's coming to a merciful end sometime soon.

I know he upgrades your weapons and stuff but the party has a much closer relationship with Cindy so she might as well be this game’s Cid.

Maybe it’s petty and she technically is this game’s Cid even though her name is different but it is one thing that’s bothered me for 3 years lol. Does anyone else feel the same?",1

It feels like it takes close to 10 minutes to be same level enemies and I get very little experience out of it. And that's when I find enemies to fight. I rarely use the Regalia and I still have problems finding enemies anywhere.

900,"Which Final Fantasy XV content should be archived?Yesterday I opened a thread where I explained that I have created a fan page for Final Fantasy XV, where there are two projects for FF15. The first project was a translated version of ""Parting Ways"" in German. Shortly thereafter, I was informed that there is already an official German version. Shame about my time.

The second project is the ""Archive Project."" There are countless collateral materials to Final Fantasy XV. From anime about a movie and spin-off games. And anyone who knows Square knows that it is not certain that this content will always be available.

As an example we would have the two mobile games ""Justice Monsters Five"" and ""King's Knight"". Both can now no longer be played on mobile and the former is only available in the main game at vending machines. That's why the Archive-project was launched.

The goal is to retain as many relevant side-material as possible, to allow players to have the fullest possible experience with Final Fantasy XV.

To put it directly: The archived materials were all obtained legally and in compliance with the (German) law. We are non-commercial and have no personal benefits from this project. We do it all in our free time. We will also post our backups on our website only if certain media are no longer available on official channels (Youtube-Chanel, official websites, etc.) and / or require an absurd price to procure official copies.

As I said. Our goal is to keep future games of Final Fantasy XV open at all times to provide the most complete experience possible.

At the moment we have the following archived both digitally and physically:

&amp;#x200B;

Dawn Trailer

Omen trailer

Omen Trailer 2.0

A Walkthrough of ""A Kings Tale""

A Walkthrough of ""Platinum Demo""

A Walkthrough of ""Episode Duscae""

Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV with german and english subtitles

The German and English version of ""Parting Ways""

&amp;#x200B;

Current in Work is ""Episode Ardyn: Prologue"" with the official German Subtitles.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question to you is now: What else should be archived? Are there any trailers that you consider important? Or other side-materials? I'm curious!",1
902,"The Best Mediocre Game Of The FranchiseThe game was so mediocre.  Seemed like a mess of a AAA game that Square wanted to push out the door. The lore and what makes the world so interesting is not in the game, but in movies, spin-offs, books, separate video games.. ect.. Seemed like it was two separate games held together by ducktape (Open World/Linear Pathway on rails). 

Chapter 13 especially sucked. Running down corridors and unlocking doors and turning on power for 30 minutes while Ayrden? tells you that you’re powerless while destroying deamons was the worst thing, (besides the shit boss fight with leviathan) that i’ve ever had to do in a video game on PS4. 

I also feel ripped off. I’ve watched many ’trailers’ for the game before playing it and next to none of it is in the actual game (except combat mechanics and the Gods).. entire sequences were scrapped/removed). None of the pre-rendered ‘movie cutscences had any volume at all. The story was awful. The ’skills’ were irrelevent. 

Literally the only cool thing were the Gods and riding Chocobos. 

the sidequests and hunts were terrible. The ‘love interest’ with Luna’s death was the most unearned emotion in a final fantasy game. Alot of the English Dub was just terrible and awkward.

Please don't take this as me dumping on OP! Latin is a really difficult language even when written correctly, which the lyrics to this song definitely are not. But it's been bugging me for over a year now, so I finally decided to sit down and put my Latin degree to use.


&amp;nbsp;


This probably isn't 100% accurate either - like I said, the original Latin is dodgy, so there was a lot of having to guess what the author might have *intended* to write rather than translating the grammatical nonsense that they actually wrote. But this is definitely a lot more accurate than the previous translation.

What I really would have loved in the full game would be thr weapon skills you activate with the triangle button. Thats was certainly cool!

I can confirm that this is a thing. There is one workaround, you can downgrade game manually to version 1.25 (the last stable Steam release), but doing that also disables some of additional content, including Episode Ardyn compatibility. Sure, you can blaze through the base game and three episodes on 1.25 and then update your game to play Ardyn, but... why bother if you have possibility to buy the game on other store and have zero problems with it? After playing FFXV on PS4 at launch I was eager to replay it on PC, bought the Steam version only to discover that it's stuttery mess. Bought again yesterday on Origin and man... the difference is real.

&gt; It's worth mentioning, too, that the majority of mods, particularly Steam Workshop mods, don't work on the Origin or Microsoft Store version. (Worth mentioning because I answered enough ""how do I use mods on my non-steam version"" questions over the years.) So it's very much a pick your poison.",1

976,"FFVX Royal Pack what to doHi,

so lately I decided to get the royal pack dlc for my base game. I already have the base game since 2 years, so I already played it through at least once. So I downloaded the dlc content and now I don't know what to do.

I have a NewGame+ File and a old Save File where I already finished the game (lvl 64 or smth like that) and a new game with no + content. I tried getting the boat in each of those files or any other content but nothing works. I didn't even recieve a msg that the royal pack dlc was installed, when I opened the game.

So now I dont know what to do anymore and rly need help. Pls somebody tell me what exactly you did after you purchased the dlc and what happened? Like wich file did you use? And wich chapter and so on?

Thx in advance :)",1
