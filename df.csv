8,"Why Cyberpunk?I noticed in the thread about the changed style in the remake, that a lot of people are saying the original was Cyberpunk in aesthetic. I was wondering why? 

The original had plot themes associated with cyberpunk (corporate corruption etc.) but the visual style was Dieselpunk with heavy art deco influence, which is actually a lot more unique than cyberpunk. And that was only really in Midgar and Junon.

There aren't a lot of cyber punk elements for how long the game is. Some of the reactor interiors look cyberpunk, such as that lift and the Hojo related stuff, but just as many are plain industrial. 

Outside of that, here's a smattering of neon in Wall Market, otherwise most of the lighting appears to be normal light bulbs except green. The gold saucer is intentionally too garish to be cyberpunk (IMO).  Barret and Dyne have cybernetics but it is just those two. There's no internet, no vr.  The robots are mostly big chunky steampunk looking things, they actually look more cyberpunk now with the extra detail.

There's not a lot that is high tech or futuristic in FF7 outside the robot enemies. I think the most tech they show is a mobile phone. Which, again goes against the cyberpunk argument.

What do people think?",0

10,"How should I re-experience FF7?Hi

FF7 remake is coming soon, and I loved this game since i started gaming. However I just realised I played it twice when i was like 12-13, then never played it again.  

I want to get the best nostalgic experience as possible. There are 2 choices :

* Either I play again the original game before the remake comes out. Got to feel everything just like i experienced it as a kid (visuals, music, memories, etc...). But risking getting disappointed since the game is way better and prettier in my head due to nostalgia.
* Or i just play the remake right away, and let the remade music and better graphics and dialogue retrace my fading memory of the game.

Anyone played a ""remade"" game years after playing the original, without coming back to the original? How was it like? Which way is better in your opinion and why?

This close to release I'm sure if there were an actual system in place for this it would have been discussed in detail, so we won't see Dual and Triple Techs in the same style as Chrono Trigger (i.e. two characters sharing the ability).  This is more so using two abilities at once for greater damage.

61,"Debate about the Open City VS Linearity VS Semi Open ZoneHey there :) Just a little post to see what you guys would think since whe have a few info about it.

Recently, I've watch few streams of CC2 ""Dragon Ball Kakarot"". It seems that the game kept a certain mechanic (Time slowing down while chosing a capacity in combat. Huh... where did I saw that again ? :smirk: )  and choose to go for an ""Open World"" which is basicaly multiple ""wide"" area link through a map where you chose to teleport or not. 

I feel that I've saw this mechanic in JRPG lately : Kingdom Hearts 3 being one of the most recent one, multiple wide area connected to each other via loading screen or giant world map selection.  
(I'm not covering Zelda on purpose since it's not really a JRPG in my opinion)

It would really bother me to see Midgard getting the same treatment.

I would rather have a full explorable city rather OR a linear story but with wide zone to each segment. But not something halfway because well, dividing a city into zone wouldnt make much sense to me (if so, why not just remake the whole game like that ? )

66,"Already stressed about deciding the battling systemAm I the only one with this problem already? Since the announce that the game is going to include a 'classical'-option for the battle system, I've been trying to decide should I play it with that option or the regular one. And the game is not even out yet. I'm not really that good at action games and I must admit that I often play them on easy mode (since I hate getting stuck on a boss with a million different navigation and action commands games have these days). What I've understood, the 'classical'-option for battle system basically handles the manual, regular attacking for you and you just choose the special moves like magic etc. I wonder if it will get boring like that and if the difficulty can be changed afterwards. Anyone else contemplating this?",0
67,"What's your playstyle likely going to be?The way I see it there'll be 5 or so different playstyles available;

**Action** Pretty simple, utilising a more action oriented style using shortcuts and combos, likely to stick to a main character and swap only when necessary, possibly just issue commands without switching.

**Classic** As the mode suggests, playing the game in classic mode, switching between characters to use ATB abilities as they pop up

**Main Character Focused** Sticking to a single character who you'd main and issueing commands to the rest without switching, while still heavily using the command menu.

**Switch on a wim** This is seemingly the most popular playstyle based on demo playthroughs I've seen, basically just run with a character until you get bored and then switch to another, rinse and repeat, generally ends up with ATB bars being saved longer than they really should be.

**ATB &amp; Switch** This is probably going to be the most min maxed way to play, basically just using a character until their ATB gauge is full, expeding the bars then switching to the character with the second highest atb, getting theirs up and rinse and repeat.

I think I'm likely to play more towards the ATB &amp; Switch style, it seems to be that nice middle ground between the original and the new, I was a bit disapointed at there seemingly not being a way to switch the directionals with R2 + L2 as I'd find that a much more comfidable way to switch so frequently, but the dualshock back paddle has got good reviews so I might splash out for that which will achieve the same function.

76,"Am I the only one who is hoping they include a ""classic"" combat mode?I would like to preface this with the fact i am not a FFVII purist or fangirl, in fact my top fav FF game is FFIII(SNES)/VI. That being said, I merely enjoy classic JRPG combat systems more than action based ones.

What I mean is they make it so that you have ""action mode"" where you can actively use attacks and such like in the action rpg style but in classic mode, it plays similarly to how the original FF7 played with you manually inputting commands.

Honestly, based on what I've seen, this wouldn't be too hard given that tactical mode already allows you to slow things to a near standstill to begin with. It wouldn't be that big of a stretch to believe that a ""classic mode"" could merely pause foes in place with bouts of action taking place after each command has been inputted followed by another pause after all foes and player actions have executed.

Though EXTREMELY UNLIKELY they could go the extra mile and have classic mode literally be identical to the classic FFVII combat system completely with random encounters just with updated graphics and a few extra quick time events during combat.

This is of course wishful thinking on my part and i'm sure FFVII Remake will be good no matter how it turns out but I would admit that it would be a huge nod to FF fans IF they did include a class mode.

Thoughts?",0
77,"Why does the Eng version of FFVII Remake have so many differences from the Jp version? (no leak info) (enemy/ability name spoilers)I'm getting the Japanese version of Remake and as such I've been fallowing the news in both languages and I've noticed a some things in the Eng version that make me scratch my head. 

The biggest one is the decision to get a completely new voice cast even for characters nobody ever had a problem with like Reno, whereas in Japan seemingly all the old voice cast is getting their roles back. Some people might say ""who cares? the Eng AC voice cast was never good in the first place"", and while I don't necessarily disagree with that, Could's Eng VA already showed in Crisis Core he can play a ""non emo"" Cloud so it's not really necessary to change it. 

But also, the Japanese voice cast had a similar situation as well. Tifa's Japanese VA was considered the worst one in KH2 and AC (and she kinda was), but over time she improved, to the point where in World of FF and now in Remake the Jp fans are very happy with her performance. Long story short, it is completely possible for a VA to improve over time.

But it's not just the voices that are different, enemy and ability names are as well. Guard Scorpion is now Scorpion Sentinel, Blade Beam is now Blade Blast and it seems Motor Ball is now M.O.T.O.R but in Japan they're the original names.

Mainly I'm curious who made these decisions, the Japanese side or the american side? If it was the Japanese side why wouldn't they be making the same changes to that version? If it's the american side why go out of the way to make all these changes? Is this just a case of ""overzealous localization"" rearing it's ugly head again because somebody at US Square thinks the original names are ""too silly"" or ""no one's gonna take it seriously""?

tldr: Various enemies and abillites are getting new names in English and the entire Eng voice cast is different but in Japanese it's all the same as the original and I don't get why.",0
78,"The Watchmen of Fate could fix the problems with *that* scene. (OG spoilers)The Aerith death scene has one glaring flaw, the other party members. They just stand by and do nothing as Cloud draws his sword, before Cloud strikes they yell one short sentence and then they just watch as Sephiroth leaves, then they come in to grieve Aerith.

Obviously this will not work in the Remake, the party members should be watching Cloud like a hawk considering what he does at the Temple.

They could make it so the party does try to step in as soon as Cloud starts to act strange but the Watchmen keep them at bay. This would fix the only problem with the scene and make it truly perfect.",0
79,They be running mate!! *joke* this is not the case. I very much look forward to both games!,0
80,"Potential benefits of ""episodic"" releases.Lots of people have reservations about the episodic nature of the Remake, and while plenty of others (myself included) aren't really concerned about it.

But I've never seen anyone talk about possible benefits an episodic release could have so I thought I'd list some of the things I came up with.

&amp;#x200B;

1. If (god forbid) something in Remake part one ends up being widely disliked (summons being too limited, not enough exploration, ect) they can take steps to fix those problems in the later parts. The Watchmen of Fate for example. I haven't seen the leaks so I don't know all the details but I've seen a lot of people complaining about them &gt;!because they get shoved into scenes or whatever!&lt;. If everyone hates them in part one they could be way less prevalent going forward.
2. There are a lot of amazing things in FFVII but just like any jrpg or longer game it can be hard to replay your favorite parts from mid to late game whenever you want, for example the Golden Saucer date is a fan favorite but it can take a solid 12 hours of game time to get there and if you want to see all the possible dates yourself without looking it up on youtube you need to play the game 4 different times choosing the correct dialogue options. We don't know how the affection point system will work in Remake yet but I bet it'll be considerably streamlined so that you won't have to play through Midgar to get different results.",0

91,"As we saw in trailers the watch men of fate were going crazy near 7th heaven at some point and all the citizens were out of sight.Do you guys think they will continue to pop up like that, seemingly scaring away everyone near by through out the whole remake series? If so how will that make the game feel overall? And how will that make npcs look at the party members? As hope or bringers of chaos? What do you guys think?",0
92,"OG7, 7R, and Aerith. Potentially Massive Spoilers inside.So it was suggested that the Whispers of Fate only appear when the story deviates from the original and this got me thinking a lot. Basically it comes down to that if chapter 1 and 3 are all OG7 content and chapter 2 is new content the Whispers would only appear in chapter 2. So in this way the story of the Whispers would be a separate one that runs parallel to the OG7 story without ever fully overlapping.


This also creates a major opportunity to expand on the lore and do some other crazy things but effectively change nothing. Here's where it gets really wild though, it's a big if, but if Nomura approached it in this fashion the remake could include two versions of the game. One being the remake story with all the new content and another version that simply skips the chapters involving the Whispers to keep the purist fans happy. That OG version of the game would be shorter but it would be a great addition. Another major benefit is that this wouldn't take any serious extra effort to develop, it's essentially a boolean switch that says to skip certain chapters if playing the OG version.


Now building on this. In this hypothetical side story of the remake we can (likely in part 3) have a sort of Avengers Endgame plot that involves going back and preventing Aeriths death. By splitting the games into two game types OG and Remake this won’t hurt the OG version for purist fans as it would only occur in the Remake story and include the Whispers of Fate. Here’s the big thing though, the Aerith lives portion of the remake story would tie back into the OG story when it is realized that Aerith has to sacrifice herself to call Holy. At this point Cloud and the gang use whatever power of the ancients to summon up the Whispers to ensure the story is set on a path that leads to Aeriths death. This would also help to build closure for Cloud with her death, he was able to see what happens if she were to survive and comes to terms that this is how things had to be for the world to be saved. 


In this way the game would be almost a meta sequel/prequel to OG7 while still keeping the OG7 part of the game intact and playable without the Whipsers. We'd also get a chance at seeing that alternate world where she survives despite that it ultimately ends in tragedy.

Edit: Everyone's acting like I think they should change the games story, I don't. Fact is they already changed it by adding the Whispers of Fate. It's going to be different. I'm just suggesting how having a classic and remake story mode would be cool as we'd have the option to experience the Whispers or not. Also if the Whispers don't appear until major new story events happen it would be easy to implement these two story versions without reworking every bit of the game.",0

95,"Final Fantasy 7R: Episode 1 is the 'easy part'(Mild to Moderate spoilers for original game present in this rant. You've been duly warned.)  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I dont mean to burst everyone's bubbles, but this upcoming chapter is without a doubt the easiest part of the game to adapt to modern tastes. It all gets harder from here, and we'll be signing onto this series of games with this purchase without the real questions answered.  


For instance, The Midgar section of FF7 serves in many ways as the world's longest intro scene. The entire thing is heavily scripted, on rails, and framed to be cinematic. This is right in the wheelhouse of a modern ARPG presentation.  


But after this, we have amorphous goals, globetrotting, towns that serve little purpose, overworld exploration, and a massive narrative shift that goes from cyberpunk action adventure to exploring a largely rural, low tech world at your leisure. There's also the dating system which will now span across a minimum of two games to track player input (assuming its implemented like it was), Cait Sith and the entire can of worms he represents, and massive stretches where the narrative beats often have multi-hour gaps in between. We've seen and heard not a thing about how mechanics as simple as the airship will be handled. Full planet exploration? (unlikely), Menu selection of desired destination? How about the fact that the game becomes one long convoluted existential crisis? Or that nearly all the Sephiroth sightings are really Jenova cells doing a John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" impression of Sephiroth, and that that only truly becomes clear after the first playthrough?  


Basically, Final Fantasy 7R will have a 'Two Towers' moment, where the whole narrative forces some radical decision making in order for the presentation to work just like the breaking of the fellowship did for the film adaptations.  


I'm rather positive they're gonna stick the landing of episode one. Its a straightforward good versus evil adventure story. I'm far less convinced the subsequent entries will be able to do the same. And then we'll all be reliving a 'The Force Awakens' nightmare, with a first episode that seems like a solid foundation all followed up by nightmare fuel we'd all rather pretend didn't happen.",0

Emailed them following the delay and they said in the event of a bank holiday weekend (Easter weekend when FF7R releases) that they 'usually' get the game the day before and distribute it accordingly.

I'm wondering if it's worth being optimistic and holding on to hope for this, or if a cancellation is worth it and seeing if there's somewhere I could grab it from on the Friday morning as a guaranteed alternative?

109,"Speculation - Affection System in Remake?Hi all. This is my first post. I hope this isn't a repetitive topic. =)

So in the OG game there was a really fun affection system that I loved. I replayed the 1st disc so many times just because I wanted to get all the date scenes. XD Since the game is being split into parts how do you think the affection system will work? In the original game the Midgar portion had a good amount of opportunities to increase or decrease affection values for the dateable characters that were presented (ex. Aerith giving Cloud the flower).  However, since the remake only covers Midgar it might be silly to even include the affection values here because Gold Saucer isn't available as a reward. 

Do you think the affection system will just not be used in the Midgar version of the remake? Do you think they'd have an affection system with a small reward/cutscene towards the near-end of the game? If so, maybe including Jessie in the affection system as a replacement for Yuffie? Do you think that it'll be only introduced in Part II? How would you like the affection system to work? Do you think SE has the foresight/ability to let affection values transfer over to the next parts?",0

132,"The very smooth transition from pre-rendered cu-tscene to real-time graphicsHi, I was staring really close at the screen to find differences between pre-rendered and real-time stuff. And like always with Final Fantasy, it's just commendable how very smooth they handle the transition between pre-rendered videos and actual ingame graphics rendered by your local PS4 in real time. 

https://preview.redd.it/swsmv8ud8ra41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bf9467310f2def4ff4769db5c80f20e8417843

After smoke comes up, which makes the screen flash up to white, the video is exchanged with real-time graphics while the smoke fades. The camera is also moving forward in a steady way so it's really almost unnoticeable. Only on the screenshots above you can see a slight change in the lighting tone. 

Don't judge the game's graphics too much based on this last screen. I zoomed into the video footage's upper left corner to focus attention on the train yard's details here and the game also appears to implement some variable resolution. So the aliased legs of the soldier would appear completely smooth a second later. I tried some pixel-counting, but it's really hard in this game. There is some excellent post-processing that smoothes out aliasment all the time and the geometry is too complex to find good edges when not playing myself.

All the details on the background are kept in tact from the pre-rendered sequence and the train seems identical. But some details are added on the left after the transition. However, it's hard to tell as the angle is not entirely the same, because the camera is constantly moving forward as stated above. 

I can't wait to get my hands at the game. I have so much nostalgia and love for the game's story, world and music. But I also love how gorgeous the remake looks. Not just from the technical side, but also aesthetically.",0

Like, I can imagine the chocobo ranch guy we meet outside Kalm before going through the swamp to be like the chocobo ranch guy from XV. Just one building, maybe a small barn attached to it, chocobos posted up outside and such then further out we get to the actual swamp, etc. But like Kalm itself, being an actual town we can walk into and through. 

Same for all the other areas of the game, especially places that didn't really get a great deal of attention to them (had to google search cause my memory isn't that hot) such as Bone Village or Mideel, including side quests and things to explore lore on areas they really just kind of brushed over, likely due to memory constraints in the OG.

Gameplay-wise it could be really cool too, they could come up with a whole ""Fusion sword system"" that plays differently from the base game and let you ride around the wasteland on Fenrir with some unique bike combat.

144,"How knowing that there's a planned demo has made me feel so far (TLDR at the end)Note : Sorry if my English hurts you, not my native language.

I don't know if some of you can relate, but since the leaks about the demo being updated to the psn, I'm not myself anymore.

Let me explain with a bit of backstory :

Since the Tech demo that was made to show off the graphic potential of the PS3, many years ago, I was desperately hoping, every single year, during every single E3 event, that square would announce a remake.

Years go by, one after the other, without any trace of a remake.

The year when I thought ""oh well, fine, I get it, they won't ever do it..."" BOOM, the news came in like a wrecking ball (yes), an earthquake in the world of gaming, gave goosebumps to every single FFVII fanboys and fangirls out there (I wish I was in the audience at E3 that day). Hope was back and from that first announcement, I knew SE would give us the best FF experience, putting love in the game like never before. I never doubted, for me, SE will make this game AWESOME.

So we come to know the date, March 3rd, which seemed so far for me... I first played the OG with my cousin back when I was 9 (now 31) and I think I played it more than ten times over the years. I completed it only once 100% for the challenge. I played it again recently, for the good old memories. Also to help make the time pass faster, I guess.

Through this November, I was obviously hoping for a demo to be released as a Christmas or new year's gift from SE.

That's where the leaks fucked with my mind.

I do honestly think that I could handle the wait better if that leak was kept secret (which, well, doesn't make it a leak anymore) or at least that I would never hear of it. I thought the demo would definitely come out during the holidays, which would somehow have been the greatest gift of all for the fan I am. So far, I was at least able to keep me away from any video showing the leaked demo and what's inside it, because I want to protect my hype.

So, the time goes by, holidays are now over, and still no sign of the demo on the psn...

I swear, since that psn leak, I've been waaaaaaaaaaay too often refreshing this sub, SE and FFVIIR's twitter accounts, all the gaming channels I subscribed on youtube, searching for any news, any announcement, any hint on when the demo will finally drop... I mean, I can't concentrate well at everything I'm doing just because I want that demo so hard. It feels like a drug I need so I can feel better. And god how the time has been slowing since then. I still wonder why they uploaded it so soon to the psn though.

At this point I wish they never prepared a demo, because every single day that passes without the demo being available feels like a worthless and empty day.

Am I the only one?

TLDR; I'm some kind of wandering ghost in my life since the demo leak, waiting for one and only one thing, being able to play it before the game comes out. I feel empty. Please help.

EDIT : Brace yourselves my friends, it's official, the game is being delayed to April 10th... I feel dead inside right now XD Please give the demo SE. PLEASE.",0

FFXIII has a lot too, my favorite was shiva transformation

FfXV is when it started to have small amount of pre rendered cutscenes, opening/ luna  in the water/ end

I really hope they should add more in FFVII

150,"What if...The reason the upcoming release is called 'FF7 Remake' and not 'FF7 Remake part 1' is because the subsequent parts are going to be released as DLC for this game and not as separate games? This would work to make sure that stats carry over from one part to another as opposed to needing to transfer stats to a separate game, and would also work to keep players from starting in the middle of the series by buying part 2 without part 1. You would buy part 2 as DLC but couldn't play it until you completed the base part of the game.

167,"Could ""Midgar"" also mean the area?Square Enix said Part 1 only covers up to the point where the characters escape Midgar.

Some people might say that the name ""Midgar"" can actually mean two things: the literal city, or the area around it as well. (Kind of like New York vs. New York City.)

I have only seen two pieces of evidence to back this up:

- After you exit Midgar (city), and walk around a little on the World Map, go to the Main Menu, and you'll see the name of your location is ""Midgar Area"". However, one counter argument to this is, the game also does this for lots of other cities, including ""Junon Area"", ""Cosmo Area"", ""Wutai Area"", etc.
- After you go to Kalm, then go to the chocobo ranch and get a chocobo, so you can cross the swamp on the west side of the continent, to avoid that large snake-like monster... Well, the name of the monster is ""Midgar Zolom"". However, one counter argument to this is, the name of the monster might just indicate the closest city.

I have searched all the text in the game, and I don't see any other evidence for this.

By the way, in case anyone is curious, I'll give a few other textual references to Midgar:

- In the Shinra building, remember the ""Midgar parts""? (Lego-like puzzle of Midgar. One of the ""Key items"" in the game. In this case, just represents the city itself.)
- In the Shinra building's library, one of the books talks about ""animals living near Midgar"". Other books also talk about Neo-Midgar.
- On the same floor is that guy that introduces himself as ""Domino, the mayor of Midgar"". (Also, when the password is ""KING"", he says ""President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!""

Anyway, the main reason for my posting this is, a lot of people are being very hopeful that Part 1 is going to extend beyond Midgar city and have an open world, and they're pointing to things like ""Midgar Area"" and ""Midgar Zolom"" as their ""proof"".

I'm just here to say that I myself used to think this, but like I said, I've searched all the text in the game and don't see any other evidence, so I wouldn't get your hopes up.

And I'll give one last counter argument. If Part 1 ends where the party ""escapes Midgar"", then where exactly would that be? After crossing the swamp? After going through the cave? These don't really seem like dramatic places to end the game.

My advice: Try not to get your hopes up. Open world is very doubtful. And besides, does it matter that much where it ends? The most important thing is just for Part 1 to include a lot of great content.

So, don't **expect** it. That way, you won't be disappointed. And if it does go beyond the city, consider it a bonus surprise.",0

Nanaki, Red XIII, Red, XIII, or anything the player decides even. What do you call him and why do you call him that? Do you disapprove of calling him a different name?

I'm genuinely curious, as since the time after I had first learned the name given to him by his family, I have always named him Nanaki unless the run is just a messing around run, where I name the characters something that sounds cool or comedic. 

That being said, I don't have anything against somebody that calls him Red, or Red XIII (although, personally, saying Red XIII everytime I saw it in the dialogue was a cognitive mouthful, which likely helped influence my decision to change his nickname to his real name), I'm just curious if there is any reason you prefer one option over any of the others.

With all this in mind, any thoughts on how his name will be spoken in the remake? I feel like the team will use Red for the most part, occasionally calling him Nanaki when the future parts of the game release. I have high doubts we will hear him be called Red XIII more than a couple times, those couple being said for the finale of this first part of the remake.",0

For example, if I played part 1 and leveled my party to level 99 and had all materia etc available in the game then surely this would be way too OP for Part 2 which would suggest you would have to start again from scratch. 

I do not know any spoilers from the leaks so going off what I have read previously about the game I believe not all summons etc are available in part 1 which in my mind would make me think that you would retain Ifirit and others available in Part 1 for use in Part 2 and beyond which would contradict starting from scratch.

Flip side of that same coin, I'd love to have a better understanding of what Jenova's origins. Is it from a planet of other similar lifeforms? Is it merely a parasite that travels through the void of space looking for a host planet? With the episodic breakdown of the game, including possible DLC down the line, it would be nice if we could get a deeper understanding of the backstory and not necessarily just new minigames, gameplay elements, Roche-type characters, etc.

I've seen a *lot* of people who have dismissed him outright, either because his hair looks stupid or the bike flips look stupid or because his personality seems stupid blah blah blah...

But, I've also seen some people overreacting in the opposite direction. Saying he's going to be the last boss, because he's a new character and he's on a bike and Nomura hinted you won't fight Motorball as the last boss so *clearly*... he's the new final boss. 

Both of these things are ridiculous overreactions. Roche is nothing more than a new B tier villain to give you more to do in Midgar. After all in the original you only fight two human bosses in Midgar, Reno and Rufus. Makes sense they'd want to give you some more.

Also if you think about it, in the original Soldiers were kind of underutilized, there's only two real Soldiers in the whole game. I for one am happy to see the Soldier ranks fill out a bit.

Bit of a side note but why are people so against the bike flips? Just cuz they come from AC? Have people forgotten all the dumb nonsense in original FFVII? The bike shit doesn't even come close to the dumbest stuff from the original.",0

193,"Should I pre-order Gamestop or Amazon?? *my story inside*Ok so I'll try to keep this short, I pre-orderd the deluxe edition WAY back June. I was on amazon today and went to look in if I wanted to get the collectors edition instead, I decided I still dont think the collector's edition in the end however. But while looking at my order, it was a good thing I checked because I set the delivery to my moms house an hour away because we were in the middle of house hunting at the time and I didn't know where thus playing the game wasnt at the forefront of my my priority list, 

but now that we have a place I'm 1000% pumped and even took the day off for the big day march 3rd, and driving an hour up and back is NO LONGER a desirable outcome, now here comes the issue.

Amazon for whatever reason wont let me change my shipping address online, and when I was justtttt about cancel my old preorder and re-ordee it I realized the deluxe price in june was $70, now is $80 before shipping and taxes WTF! $10 extra penalty cuz of a slip up on my part if I cancel and reorder is a headache, I'm thinking I can deal with amazon preorder but then I thought...lemme check gamestop.

Gamestop is also $80, but it comes with an extra bonus of that sweet Shinra Serial card + I dont have to wait for my mail man on D-Day, I can just get up and grab it.

But I had a issue with Gamestop for the FF15 release, I posted the situation in gamefaqs and it caused a huge debate that maxed the 500-post, the short version is they called me to pick up FF15 a day early which was awesome cuz I'd be out of town for a week, they said they'd close at 5, I got there at 4:54 and the gates were down and the most teen angsty employee with an attitude shrugged me off and told me I should've got there earlier as he hopped in the passenger of his moms SUV.

I swore to never buy a game at gamestop since, I do buy my POPS from.there tho and I will say the gamestop near me is quite nice, but my vow....MY VOW!!!

long story short should I call up amazon and see if they can fix this $10 debacle or just preorder with gamestop? How many going the gamestop way?

TL;DR Amazon is trying to screw my out of $10 rightfully cuz I messed up my previous preorder address, gamestop has the preorder for the same price but I get a bonus item and can pick it up whenever I want instead of waiting on delivery but they screwed me on my FF15 instore preorder so I'm once bitten twice shy",0

I haven't even seen the latest trailers (I stopped at the first gameplay trailer that was shown). So please don't spoil anything. I've never even played the original game!

However, I knew that the last screen of the demo allows you to choose the version of FFVIIR to buy. This is the only thing I have seen from the stolen demo, and I took a screenshot from a YouTube video of the full demo. Here it is.

https://preview.redd.it/5z2wqhkwws941.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d561208630512fc9f6ca953291bbc5ef828ad52c

It seems that at the end of the demo there is a screen to ""purchase"" the game, not to ""pre-order"" it.

If the demo release had been scheduled before the release of the actual game, the screen would probably have been ""Pre-Order Now!"". It is true that to make a preorder it is necessary to pay the full price, therefore one might think that the word ""purchase"" is used in a generic way. But the pre-order bonuses are missing in the game versions shown on the screen.

So let's resign... those who pre-ordered the game will probably never play the demo, because the demo will most likely be released together with the full game.

**Edit:**

* There is still hope for the FFVIIR demo! 🤗👦🏼🔪
   * As it was written in the comments (thank you all), apparently the *Devil May Cry V* demo also had a ""purchase"" screen and was released before the full game. Obviously I didn't know.
   * Also, again from the comments, It was pointed out that the stolen demo is a part of an obviously unfinished version of the game, probably with some bugs, or the like. It would not be suitable for advertising the game after launch. I don't know if this means that a second demo will be released in the future, but we'll see. But as for the stolen-demo we're all waiting for, it would make more sense to release it during this month.",0

200,"In the new air buster fight it looks like air buster kinda hovers near the sides of the bridge.Even though they changed this from the party being separated on each side of it like in the og I expect this to still be a cool fight. However, I would like for there to be a boss battle where two characters are put on a different side from one other character for a challenge. For example, the two characters on one side needing to keep up their damage output consistently to keep the character on the other side from some type of instant death from the boss while the one character is required to maintain certain tactics too to keep the battle going. I wonder if these kinds of placements of party members will be a thing in this game at times to increase challenge. I could even see this concept being applied to the weapon fights to make them more suitable for being super bosses in an ARPG unlike adamantoise in ff15 where you just hit it over and over for a super long time. Like each party member could be split up, one on the face, arm, and knee? This way we can still fight the weapons as huge as they are while keeping the fights challenging. In these fights the players would need to be constantly switching between party members at whatever part of the body they are at on the weapon to consistently do damage on situated and moving targets alike to eventually bring the beasts down. This would involve proper timing, skill, and learning the order of which things should be done. But What do you guys think? Should placement at boss fights be a mechanic in this game?

215,"Transportation options across game partsSo, in the original game, you start off on foot, then right after Midgar you can get a chocobo, then later you get a land vehicle, then later a water vehicle, then an air vehicle. That's literally how the game gradually gave you physical access to more and more locations in the game.

For a single game, that works great. But I somehow doubt the Remake will be done in the same way. Think about it.

Do you really think Part 2 will be ""open world right after Midgar"" where you start off immediately with a Chocobo and end with a land vehicle?

Do you really think Part 3 will be ""open world"" where you immediately start off with a relatively fast vehicle and have the ability to travel to large sections of the game right away?

I'm pretty sure they're gonna make some very creative changes and improvements around vehicles, assuming the game is split up into chunks.

(I still hope that Square Enix will surprise us and make Part 1 expand a bit BEYOND Midgar, and become ""semi open world"", but only be able to explore one little continent, then instead of releasing Parts 2 and 3 etc. as separate games, release them as large expansions on the original game. That way, we get more of a ""continuous"" experience, and don't end up with something like Compilation where some parts are awesome but others suck.)",0

As release day for FFVIIR approaches, I'm beginning to worry that some of the narrative elements from the ""Compilation"" series might be incorporated into the remake.

226,"Where will Part 1 end?In the original game, the motorcycle scene was at the very end of Midgar.

In the Remake trailer, Cloud INTRODUCES Roche to the party as ""a SOLDIER"" during the motorcycle scene.

Do you really think Part 1 will be over right at the end of the motorcycle scene? That would mean Roche is the final boss, or one of the final bosses, but it doesn't seem like Square would INTRODUCE a final boss to the party right before the end of the game.

So, to me, it seems this means one of the following:

- trailer is misleading, Roche is actually introduced much earlier than the motorcycle scene
- story is modified so that the party gets motorcycles much earlier than escaping Midgar
- Part 1 extends beyond Midgar, at least a little bit

I hope it's the last one. :D

228,"We should not expecting a demo this month.to;dr We shouldn't expect a FFVIIR Demo before or close to the KH3 DLC.

I've been thinking about this for the past few days and I don't think we're gonna see a demo until well into February at the earliest.
The very simple reason is that The KH3 Dlc is being released later this month.
Were I in charge of marketing I would make sure the KH3 Dlc does not compete with attention for the frankly way more anticipated FFVIIR, which includes making sure the FF Demo doesn't drop around the same time KH Dlc is being released. 
A lot of people here seem to think that there's not point for SE to hold the Demo now, but you forget that we are a minority.
Most people who are going to buy the game has no idea about the leak.
I talked to my brother earlier today, my brother who is as much a gamer as I am, but doesn't have the same passion for FF as me. He didn't know the demo had been leaked. My jaw dropped at first, but then I thought about it, and I repeat; we are a minority.

It is in SE's best interest to keep going with the marketing plan as if nothing happened, and honestly, were I in charge I would probably do the same.
Sure it sucks for us few who check this sub several times a day, hungry for more info. But what we want does not define what's best for SE.

229,"Do you guys think that it's possible to fit the rest of the content after Midgar into just two more games?I ask because I'm certain that this is going to be a masterpiece and the other parts will roll out fast because of it. Like I think when part 1 is released they will all be working on part 2 and probably switch to making part 3 faster than they did with part 2 because of how good the part 1 will sell. Where as I could see part 2 not releasing until late 2022 but I can see part 3 releasing in maybe mid 2024. That being said we would have the full base game. So is it possible to fit the rest of the game into two more parts? Would it need to be in sections like ff12 or is open worldish fine? Although making gaia completely open world seems impossible because it's a whole planet. There's many more locations,boss,dungeons,side stuff already with out them adding anything more to the rest of the game although I'm sure they will(and it's welcomed) I want all the ff7 I can get.

230,"Thought: 3 character parties, but other allies can join the fight via a Dissidia-like Assist System? (Or think how Summon actions are handled in this game.)Its a possibility that the narrative of Remake Part 1 may be handled in a way where there's only 3 characters available to fight at any given time.  However, if the entire playable cast is grouped together for certain encounters is it possible for them to still join the fight using special call-in commands that consume the current playable character's ATB?

Example: Whenever summons are summoned you're able to have them perform certain actions using your own ATB.  So let's say Aerith is not in your frontline combat party.  She has an Assist command such as ""Healing Wind"" that can be equipped by a member of the frontline party and used to temporarily call her in to cast that spell.

If anything we do know certain other party members will fight alongside your frontline 3, so its possible that could be the alternative, as well?  Not sure what technical limitations SE may have with FFVIIR using Unreal, since I believe XV was limited on character switching because of Luminous and RAM issues (which makes sense considering the small ""load"" when switching between chocobros).  However, ATB abilities can only be shortcutted to who you're controlling, where as your other members have to be used via Tactical command or switched over to, which produces a slight pause for what I'd imagine is reorientation for the player, but maybe masking loading in available commands in real-time.  However, combat doesn't appear to be as ""dynamic"" as XV in terms of what your 2 other members do on their own.  Also, the control layout currently seems suited for only controlling 3 directly (R2 and L2 are used for using other members' ATB commands while controlling your primary).. but maybe other members will still have HP, MP, ATB, but can only be controlled via the main Tactical command menu?

Either way, take everything he says with a grain of salt as tomorrow approaches. I don't know much about him myself, but after a few quick Google searches, there seem to be many forums that were at one point conversing about him being a liar.

I think I've heard somewhere that he may or may not have some bit of credibility, but I'm also willing to bet that this here is just another lie.

I was wondering if there has been any word in the remake to implement some sort of **AI behavioural system**? Such as enabling certain actions under certain conditions for the AI during combat?

I might've missed it during the presentations given to us so far (please correct me if I'm wrong!), but it seems the **AI only blocks and perform basic attacks** and does not spend ATB unless given manual commands to during combat.

This just popped into my head when I was watching some FFXII stream and they talked about the gambit system. I'm completely new to the idea of that games gambit system so I'm not sure if it's overly complicated or simplified. It just reminded me that it'd be nice to have some control over friendly AI without having to switch over characters to spend ATB all the time.

Just imagine a world where FF7, this beloved game from our childhoods, gets remade and all of us play it and say ""What did they do?? Cloud's character is all wrong, they didn't get the music right, and why am I on a casino planet when there's supposed to be a spaceship battle going on??""

It could have happened to FF7, but it didn't.

275,"A simple life analogy [regarding the leaks] that would explain why the Devs for FFVIIR are disappointed, regardless of the hype generated. (A rant of sorts for people saying it shouldn't be an issue since people are hyped)Have you ever given anyone a present? Have you ever gone out shopping to find the perfect present to give someone important to you, the perfect surprise?

After all that effort, you figure out that someone told that person what you're giving them, and they're really excited for it. You know they're genuinely happy about it, yet you'd still feel disappointed. You do care about them being happy, but \[as selfish as we are as humans\] you want to see those emotions come from you handing them that gift and them opening it in front of you. You want to be the direct source of such emotions.

I'm pretty sure Square Enix knows about all the hype, they're not stupid. They want the reactions directly coming from them revealing things. They're still humans with selfish human desires. They still want that self-gratification as much as we do when we make a conscious effort for other people. For pete's sake, this is their pet project for the decade.

We watch reaction videos to reveals just so we can hype ourselves further. We hear others scream ""WHAT?!?"" or ""OMG THEY DID IT!"" or something along those lines the first time certain items get revealed, but with leaks and spoilers going around, it's inevitable that some people will bump into them, so when they're revealed \[be it intentional or unintentional\], some reactions will be muddled with prior knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

As much as game devs want hype to generate, they want themselves to be the source of such hype, and I don't think we can fault them for that, they're still human after all, and that's why a lot of us feel bad for them and understand why they want to reveal things scheduled.

287,"Going to play both FF7s for the first time! Should I play original before or after?Hi! Most people have played the original FF7 long before there was even an idea that a remake was going to happen. They all know what the story is and people keep telling me about the nostalgia they're having and being excited and it's their best FF game ever. I've never played 7. I don't know the story. I don't even know the characters very well besides Cloud is in Smash and some of them are in Kingdom Hearts. I'm totally blind going into this.

If I play it before the new release I'd see the complete story just before the Remake Part 1 comes out. I'd get to experience what it was originally and appreciate what changes/additions they made and if they add any references or easter eggs. But it might make the remake less surprising/shiny to me. And I wouldn't be reliving a nostalgia most everyone else is going to because it'll be played back to back.

If I play it after the new release, I'll be coming out of a first parter of a whole story, I think? And then I'll be excited to see what the rest of the story is. But I'll also have to replay what I just played in a drastic downgrade visually and gameplay mechanics wise.

I guess I'd compare it to a classic film and a remake both being good. Which do you see first? The Thing from Another World or The Thing?

Thanks for the help!",0

For example:

* Should I expect noticeable frame-rate drops/skips during high-action moments?

* If ""smoothness"" is extremely important to me, possibly even more than max graphics resolution, then is downgrading the resolution an option? And if so, how will that affect screen real estate? (Would love to see a low-rez screenshot.)

At all. I can clearly see these developers are putting their heart and soul into this remake, and the screenshots prove that. Don't let this leak discourage you Square Enix/ Developers... take it as a Badge of Pride. While yes we all feel absolutely horrible for you, nobody hates these leaks. If anything it's made all of us even MORE hyped to get our hands on this remake.

297,"Summons in the remake confirmed and speculationsObviously the preorder DLC summons that will most likely be pay for dlc at a certain date separate from the game, and then the three summons we've seen in official screenshots and trailers.  


Chocobo Chick  
Cactuar  
Carbuncle  
Chocobo and Moogle ( aka: Choco/Mog )  
Shiva  
Ifrit  


Which is quite a lot considering in the OG you didn't get your first summon until After you leave Midgar.  
And the summons are quite different, they aren't just one big MP cost big hit attack, they require a bit more to be able to be summoned- perhaps the more powerful summons have heavier requirements and the weaker ones can be called out more often, but they join you in battle and assist you for a while with other attacks and buffs before doing their big finale and leaving.  


Now for speculating-   I think that Chocobo Chick and Chocobo and Moogle are going to be one and the same materia.  
I think that as you level up the materia, once it hits second or third star you might start having a chance to summon chocobo and moogle rather than just chocobo chick every time, and then when you max out the materia you'll have a chance of getting Fat Chocobo to appear instead.    
Otherwise, it just feels heavy on chocobo materia, imo...  ;)  


I'd like to think that perhaps all the summon materia could follow suit and hence you'll see additional attacks and powered up summons as the materia levels up towards mastered.  Perhaps Cactuar could become a Jumbo Cactuar or a whole group of Cactuars, even Cactuar King ? :P  Carbuncle might master out with assistance from Phoenix or have a more powerful rainbowy AoE ability than he initially had.  


Then the last bit of speculating, I think for a full fledged final fantasy title--     
I think the final summon acquired would be Bahamut for this game, and while it would be cool for him to change into Bahamut Neo then Zero-  perhaps those would be left for the next installments.

This isn't ideal obviously. However think about it this way....People LOVE Nomura's work and are so excited for his games they CANT WAIT to get their hands on whatever info they can. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine you create something so awesome they people are clamoring for all the info they can get?   


Bottom line....whether these leaks happened now or when the demo came out, they were still going to happen. Once you put the Demo file onto the internet officially or not, people were gonna start mining the data. So really, this doesn't make for as big of a disaster to Square as ya'll might think.

The game has been in development for quite some time, and has been switching studios and pretty much been ""rewritten"".

Imagine if SE intentionally put in old material in the demo, just so people would go crazy and also getting some free headlines? Think about it, all the material that is around is now being marketable by the players alone, wich means they get free marketing.

But what we dont know is that this might be heavily outdated material, so it might not spoil anything major at all? Me myself have not been looking through the leaked content, so i dont know what it looks like, but a part of me is hoping that this was all intentional and that this was their plan all along.

He subsequently came to Midgar, where he resolved to continue to pursue his vendetta against Shinra with a small but trusted group of followers.

My memory of the original game is foggy, but I recall Barret being the leader of AVALANCHE, which consisted only of the members shown in Midgar early on. This says that there is a larger AVALANCHE organization from which Barret broke off, and his actions now are independent of it. What does this mean for the game? Is this a way to instigate criticism of Barret's methods within the story? Could we, at some point, meet the main AVALANCHE organization? What does this mean for the game?",0

[When she abruptly looks towards the alley, stands up, and runs away in fear as we hear the slight hint of Sephiroth’s theme in the intro,](https://imgur.com/gallery/FNOSJiX) it was obviously hinting at something very big at play. My theory (and that’s all it is, so go easy) is I feel like Aerith will see her death very early on in a sort of premonition due to these Watchmen of Fate. She’s terrified of them because they show her her future, or ‘fate’, but she doesn’t know why.

Obviously she would hide this from the others (and the player) with only subtle hints to the OG players that she foresees her death.
Perhaps she will carry this premonition throughout the game and will hide it until she knows the details and exactly why she has to make that sacrifice (the conversation in the Sleeping Forest)

I adore my physical games, and a small part of me says that seeing as the figurine of Cloud costs like €300 or something, which is what I really wanted but cannot justify, a small part of me says to just pre-order and pre-load and just be done with it.

Because it removes a certain moral ambiguity of Barret as a character and Avalanche's. They could still write it in a way that Avalanche/Barret never knew that ShinRa is behind the first reactor bombing. From the character's perspective, they still shoulder the blame of ""killing""  the innocent. But it's how we, the player perceive the character. In the old game, the ""blood"" of the people fallen from the Reactor 1 explosion is on Avalanche/Barret's hands. It's why in a later scene, where Cait Sith/Reeves confronts the hypocrisy of Avalanche's actions, the guilt felt from Barret felt real. And from then he understood what needs to done, what wrongs that he need to do right. It's good character writing. Now their removing that aspect, how do we perceive Barret/Avalanche now, as a character? Just another fantasy hero that never do anything wrong? That's not what makes him a good character. Then what will happen to the scene where Cait Sith/Reeves confronts Barret. Are we going to see two people bickering over things that one guy accuses the other that he never did? Square promised that they won't be alter the story, but in this case they are, in my opinion, is ruining a beloved character. I genuinely don't know WHY the change is needed in the first place. The way they're handling it in the old game is already perfect. Why change it for, in my opinion, the worse? Sorry, had to vent. I like everything from the demo, except that part. Yes, it's nitpicky, I know, does it mean I'm wrong? Maybe, let's discuss.",0

370,"Expectations for RocheMore of a poll, than it is my actual expectations. I truly don’t know how I feel about him. On the surface, I like the idea of the remake adding things that weren’t in the original, and expanding on SOLDIER specifically is an idea I’m definitely drawn to. The character himself just looks and (his description) sounds like a douche, so I’m guessing I’m going to be annoyed by his character instead of being like “oh and that arc with Roche was such a welcome addition!” And it’s hard for me to say what my hopes and expectations for him are without seeing him in action first.

So to those of you who are excited about the addition of his character, what are your expectations of him, and what do you hope his fate is? Do you hope he dies by the end? Or do you hope he tracks us up and through the rest of the installments? Or maybe do you hope he becomes another guest character in the party to help us escape Midgar?

To those of you who aren’t happy he’s added to the game or think he looks douchey.. conceding the fact that he will, have some impact on the story in the remake, do you hope he’s just a one and done boss villain we kill out right? Would you be open to him serving a larger role moving forward if they implemented his character well? Can he just eat shit?

My personal expectation is to not have any, that way I’m not disappointed.. but I might be pleasantly surprised.",0
371,"So Nobuo Uematsu took an indefinite leave during 2018.Last year, there were ''news'' that Nobuo was back in it for FFVIIR, going off from an interview detail that vaguely mentioned Uematsu's involvement in the game. Shortly after that, news broke that Uematsu was taking indefinite leave for the rest of 2018, or until he was feeling better.

People are still under the assumption that Uematsu is scoring the soundtrack. And there has been no news of his return back into his industry.

So he may or may not be involved. But the music revealed so far has been met with great reception.

So the question is; will it matter if Uematsu is scoring or not?",0

375,"My guess for expanded contentThe beginning of the game will match the original all the way up until meeting Tifa in 7th Heaven. Beyond that however, I’m betting there will be new *main story* missions that have us exploring Sectors 2, 3 and 4 and blowing up those reactors. These missions will include the parachuting scene we see, the bike chases, and the scene with Roche. Which will then make the Sector 5 bombing with Tifa and Barrett the 40% and the meeting of Aerith, and those first Reno/Rude encounters the halfway point of the game or a little beyond.

I expect that for the reactor 2, 3 and 4 bombings.. we will have Barrett in our party for 1 or 2 of them with different Avalanche members in our party as “guests”. We may even have portions where we get separated from Barrett and control him solo, as shown briefly in one of the trailers.

I think this is reasonable to believe considering we didn’t see half of the Sectors in the OG.. and giving us the exploration of each one and a reactor/boss to encounter for each would be a way to expand the game.",0

381,"[Discussion] My concernsDon't get me wrong, I'm SUPER hyped for FFVII Remake, but I'm also a little worried. Tell me why I'm wrong to worry about these things:

**1. How are saves going to be transferable across episodes?**

I presume the PS4 has a way to make this a reality and I should just not worr**y.**

**2. Will each episode cost $60? So I'm paying $180 to $240 for the remake? :-/**

Maybe this can be justified in terms of pure gameplay hours and what's being added. I don't know. Hmm. I can only presume the final episode will ultimately be sold as a ""complete"" game for a MUCH reduced price.

**3. What's to stop everyone grinding their characters until Episode 2 is released (and so on)?**

Won't that just make the game really unbalanced? If Squeenix make the game automatically adjust difficulty to your character's level, won't that annoy everyone (it would annoy me, if I've grinded my characters and they're suddenly weak in the next episode).

**4. Will each episode keep growing in size?**

Given that a large part of the game becomes open world, allowing you to visit the game locations over and over, and presuming the open-world section will be divided across episodes, that means the subsequent episode (eg. Episode 3) will have to contain all the areas from Episode 2, and all the new areas for Episode 3. And if you're in Episode 4 and you decide to leave the Crater (assuming that's Episode 4), then you'll want to also be able to visit the same areas from Episodes 3 and 2.

Or will the game just keep installing in the same location, adding system files, and I'm worrying about nothing?

**5. Why don't they know how many episodes there'll be? Haven't they planned out the game yet?**

It's a bit worrying that they're adding so much to episode 1, if they're unsure where the game is going. Hmm. I guess we just have to trust them.

**6. Will FFVII Remake be finished on the PS5?**

The PS5 has an estimated release date for the end of 2020 (dev kits and hardware specs are already out). The earliest the Remake is realistically going to be finished is 2023? (Do people agree with that estimate? Thinking 1.5 years for 2 more episodes, seems pretty conservative. It'll probably be 2024 at the very earliest.) So the PS4 is surely going to be a largely dead or dying machine two/three/four years into the life of the PS5. Sqeenix will probably want to finish the game on the current gen console... so how is that going to work?

Will we have to buy the ""Remastered"" Remake for the PS5??

Tell me why these are not valid concerns!!!

386,"$60 for only up to Midgar has me a bit hesitant.Don't get me wrong, I've played and loved the original, but I feel like they are going to fill part 1 with a lot of filler material that may get repetitive and boring to justify part 1 being a 'full game.' In the original you can compete Midgar in about only 5-6hrs. I'm really curious how they can really expand Midgar only into a 'full length' game. I'm sure we are all familiar with fetch quests that are implemented to essentially add filler material. I hope it's not a lot of that type of material that we're going to get in the remake. 
Something else that concerns me is I hope you cannot mindlessly button mash your way through the game. I've played Devil May Cry 5 and found it to be a button masher that just got repetitive and kinda boring. I really hope FF7R doesn't feel that way.
Also, since the game is going to be in parts, how long would we have to wait for the next part? I hope it's not too long because I feel like some people may lose enthusiasm to pick it up again after a long wait. A huge part of the 'magic' of why ff7 was so good is that we got to play the entire story without having to wait a long time to find out what's coming next. I remember when I finished disc 1 or 2, I just couldn't wait to pop in the next disc to continue and everything was a cohesive whole. I'm not so sure if I should buy part 1 of the remake or just wait until they finish the entire game and buy the complete edition. Since I already completed the original, it's not like I don't already know what's going to happen. In all honesty, I really do hope that FF7R lives up to all the hype it has been getting.",0
387,"Red XIII in promotional adsI know everyone is being like, “Red XIII is not gonna on the first game” “He’s not on the lanyard” and such

But ask yourself, how much can they show scenes of Red XIII without spoiling most of the late part of the storyline?

You get Red XIII pretty far towards the end of the story. So most of his gameplay would showcase battles post Jenova’s escape and Shinra HQ’s facilities

There’s also even a short moment that we were led to believe that Red XIII would attack Aerith. So showing him as a playable character would totally ruin that small scene.

So in terms keeping spoilers to a minimum, situations just don’t cut it to promote Red XIII especially so early on. I’m sure Square is also trying to recreate those same moments for news players. A small teaser would be more appropriate.",0

I haven't seen much discussion about her design after the game awards 2019 trailer. 

But we started with the [May 2019 teaser trailer](https://youtu.be/Df0YG3qfZ8E). Her design was appreciated worldwide but raised some concern among a few Japanese because she didn't look asian enough.

We got a big change in the [E3 trailer](https://youtu.be/Z3xSGv3Hfio) . Aerith has a rounder head shape, different eyes and mouth. She looks more Asian as Square-enix want to satisfy the Japanese.

In the [TGS 2019 trailer](https://youtu.be/4_qjybyni28) my impression is that her design change again, as her eyes become rounder and her mouth smaller ?

A minor thought bubble, but I've always been interested in movie actresses of the past. While it wasn't a progressive time at all, it was interesting to see the advent of these highly charismatic, off-the-cuff actresses that had a certain energy and command of the camera.

I'm new to the group, so first, my apologies if this isn't allowed or I missed it in my search for the topic. 

I've been thrilled about the FFVII Remake since I first heard of it and my first concern then is my first concern now that we are so close to it's release; which platform to purchase. The last PS system I owned was a 2 which I still have for the original FFVII. Now, I know that it has been confirmed that the game will be released on March 20, 2020 for the PS4, but I'm wondering if a lot of you are in the same conundrum I am; which system to buy. Square Enix is saying just short of confirming that FFVII-R will be released on the PS5 as well as the PS4. But what about all of the other chapters? However many there will be, because we are talking years in between each chapter, will they all get a PS4 release? Is anyone else in this situation, torn between a PS4 and playing now or waiting until November 2020 with a better machine and playing then?

Thoughts, questions, suggestions are all welcome!

427,"My buddy made me a Buster Sword longboardAround 2012, way before any news of a remake was announced, my buddy and I were really in to longboarding at the time. One day we were in a lecture just talking about it and I brought up semi-jokingly how crazy it would be to have a buster sword longboard that you could just strap to your back when your not riding it lol. Clearly this was an outlandish idea, but when I was young I always thought of every and any way you could have something like a buster sword on your back for a functional purpose but there is legit never a reason to have something like that on lol.

Christmas came around that year and our friend group decided to have a Secret Santa. When it was time to receive my gift my buddy came in the room with this long wrapped present and I was taken back by how big the gift was. Opened it up and there it was, my crazy half-baked, semi-joke idea of a longboard Buster Sword. I was absolutely floored. I had no clue my buddy could press longboards or even that he could make them, but he did it. And it looks amazing.

I haven’t ever put trucks/wheels on it so I’ve never ridden it. But I plan to try at some point – tbh I don’t think it would ride very well. But ever since then it’s been up on my wall. Probably one of the coolest, most unique gifts I’ve ever received.

Building something is more fun when what your building is something you like! So, what better than FF7 and my excitement for the remake coming out.

Main functionality is you click a character and it displays some stats. I believe I grabbed these stats off the FF7 original package, where it goes over some brief stats. Haven't added the other main characters yet due to the renders not being out. But when they are, I will.

I learned a ton, it was super hard to build and please don't ask me to build it again! Haha. Anyway, enjoy!

444,"God of War style nerfingI just had this idea and it’s one I’m surprised I haven’t seen more of! But if you guys played any of the God of War games (prior to the most recent) you know what I’m getting at. Everyone is talking about data transfers, level caps, etc. but I had this thought.

You can build your party up to max level and get all this killer equipment in the first game and the game ends after the Shinra escape as advertised. The second game starts and your party has higher than averages stats, abilities and equipment, maybe even the very best attainable from the first game. The party traverses to Kalm, the Nibelheim flashback sequence happens, and then the party navigates to the lagoon where the Zolom resides and everything up until this point has served as the tutorial. The party tries to walk through the lagoon and you could imagine it’s maybe up to their waists let’s say. The Zolom erupts from the water and does serious damage to the party until a flock of chocobos come flying in and chase it off.

Cloud and crew wake up at the Chocobo farm to choco Bill being like “Thought you all were goners trying to take on that Zolom! The chocobos and I saved your skin and some of your equipment (buster sword, base level equipables and materia, etc.) but not everything unfortunately.” And in true God of War fashion, the ultimate ass-whooping means you lose the abilities and stats you’d had prior to it. And then you have to work your way back up through the course of the game.

Ultimately it doesn’t matter if it’s the Zolom or something different, but that idea of you starting out strong only to have it stripped from you early on I think would be a feasible way to pull it off. What do you guys think?",0

My question is about enemies in the game and whether or not they will respawn. I assume that during certain scripted story missions they will not (for example the first bombing mission). The reason I am wondering is that i love a bit of optional grinding to level up all my party members in the original, and getting enough gil to buy new weapons/armor for all my characters when i arrive at a new hub. It makes me more invested in all the characters (yes even you cait sith). Do any of you have information regarding this? Thanks in advance!",0

Of the Final Fantasy series I only played the XIII, which I never finished as I am not good at turn-based battles. I was unable to defeat a boss ... maybe my strategy was not good, or I had leveled the characters badly. Turn-based combat system is not for me.

I would have loved to play Kingdom Hearts series, but the presence of the Disney worlds bothers me, so I will never touch it.

Could Final Fantasy VII Remake be a good replacement for Kingdom Hearts? Could it be better?

I'm still undecided whether to pre-order it, but I will buy it anyway... I can't wait for FFVIIR to be released because I would like to find out for myself why it deserves the love of so many people... even if it's a remake.

But I hope everyone has taken the time to think about what they expect from the game so they’re no disappointed if SE fails to meet their expectations, so just a short list of what I reckon it will be like based on the footage we’ve seen so far:

-The game will most definitely end at the Shinra escape.

-Actual story content is going to clock in at 20-30hrs

-The game is going to be incredible easy and the battle mechanics (although nice) will hardly have any strategy outside of scripted boss fights

-There will be no vehicle exploration of Midgar

-Midgar will have no more sectors to explore than what was in the original and travelling between zones will have monstrous loading screens

-Side-quests are not going to be meaningful 

-Sephiroth will be ham-fisted in at every opportunity

477,"The Unused Text Series might provide insight into how the remake will expand MidgarSo I was recently reminded of the excellent [**Final Fantasy VII - The Unused Text Series**](https://thelifestream.net/ffvii-the-original/final-fantasy-vii-the-unused-text-series/).

It's interesting to see how some of the cut / shortened bits of the early game - particularly the [Sector 7 slums](https://thelifestream.net/ffvii-the-original/final-fantasy-vii-the-unused-text-series/part-2/) - line up with what we already know from trailers to be a little different about the remake.

Also, particularly these are things people have expressed some concern about.

I'm not very far through re-reading the series, but a couple of major things have stood out to me already:

## SOLDIER

There is unused text playing up Avalanche's nervousness regarding having to face SOLDIER, and ShinRa escalating their response to the bombings by dispatching SOLDIER.

As the series notes, in the OG the SOLDIER threat kinda fizzles out and turns solely into the relevant backstory bits for Cloud, Zack and Sephiroth. Aside from as regular enemies in a few locations only, SOLDIER aren't really encountered.

As much as I'm not sold on Roche so far from his design and description (quite cringey), the idea of having a legit x-class SOLDIER sent to hound Avalanche and provide recurring boss fights (and possibly even a more meaningful final boss to Midgar) is a great one, and seemingly one that stems from earlier abandoned plans in the OG.


## Sephiroth being introduced / mentioned earlier in the game.

I think some people have been afraid that showing too much Sephiroth too early compared to the OG (brief mentions and the ShinRa HQ segment) is too much of a deviation. But again, there are unused sequences in the game data where Cloud would have had a breakdown in the slums where Sephiroth actually appears before him. This makes me think a little of the trailer appearance where Cloud obviously has a vision of Sephiroth in flames, somewhere in Midgar.

Further unused bits make it clear earlier (i.e. in Midgar) that Cloud remembers/knows things about Nibelheim that Tifa thinks he shouldn't know (and she notices).

Also there is a flashback to Cloud in the van with Sephiroth on the way to Nibelheim that was meant to take place in Midgar, but presumable they decided it was superfluous in addition to the whole Kalm segment.


Anyway, hadn't seen these discussed on here, and thought it provides a bit of a look at how they're using ideas from the OG that they cut from the final release. Hope it might relax people's fears a bit as to some of the changes and new introductions, seeing where they may have come from.",0

FF7 Remake is in a weird spot, as even thought its supposed to be a full length FF game, it also only part of a whole product, this brings the idea of having Secret Bosses and Ultimate Weapons into question.   


Personally, I believe that there will definitely be a secret boss, Tetsuya Nomura almost always puts one into games he directs, However who (Or What) it might be is a mystery. As for the Ultima weapon, thats a bit more complicated. I think its pretty obvious that we wont get **THE** Ultima Weapon in FF7 Remake Part 1, but will there be some kind of stand in to take its place as the Best Weapon in the game? Im not really sure... Perhaps a goofy joke weapon or something with stupidly good stats might work, but I really don't see us getting anything close to a traditional Ultima Weapon.",0

It is known that the first game of the Remake will focus on the Midgar segment of the story, which, compared with the original, will be expanded and added depth to. That being said, the original OST features 85 tracks, 23 of which — if I'm not mistaken — take place in the Midgar segment; that's roughly just a fourth of the outstanding music FFVII has to offer.

Given the scope and length of the Remake, there will almost definitely be new locations to visit (seeing that there has already been an introduction of a new character), so it's logical to assume that there will be new tracks added to the game. Or perhaps various variations of the iconic themes.

So far, the trailers have used familiar tracks; I'm really curious to ""hear"" how music plays out in the final product.",0

First, Nomura said he was actually surprised to find out he was the director a year or two after the initial announcement.

Second, Nomura was involved in KH3 up until a year ago. The current state of ff7R right now is nearly complete, so you can assume that a lot of work was done by the time KH3 was released. Nomura would have had to juggle both projects.

Most of the complaints about FF7 in the past were about the fact that all characters were the same...no unique abilities.


Now SE fixed that giving all the characters unique controls throught their unique abilities allowing the players to create the party they want while keeping in mind that some unique abilities WONT be available to them as they wont be able to have more than 3 characters in their party.

539,"Does anyone else feel like SE is showing too much?I know we're all hyped and want to see everything including Red XIII but doesn't it seem odd that with all the Shinra building images to just drop they've basically just shown us the final dungeon? Like I get it, new stuff, new story but at its core everything that's essential to this part of the FF7 story we've seen nearly all of it. It just blows my mind that this game is built off nearly 100 GB of data and the trailers and images have shown a lot of the main story and major locations. I just find it very hard to believe this game will end as soon as they leave Midgar and given the Sephiroth and Tifa art that dropped today I'm feeling that we might see that flashback in this game since they've clearly built out Nibelheims assets.

in the original there already are restaurant you can eat at so it could be easily implemented in the remake, maybe Tifa even could cook if you bought her the ingredients  :D  


second what i really hope they keep is an auto photo mode like with Prompto in XV! looking through his photos at the end of a day was such a fun little detail that actually make a big difference in the game for me.. looking through the saved photos later really brought back all the memories and i would love that for FF7!

so i hope they give everyone flip phones (they obviously can't have smartphones :P ) with cameras and let everyone take photos! imagine how great it would be if you could look through everyone's photos when you stay at an inn or finish a mission or however this game will work!

it just seems weird, that they have SO MUCH DONE, but all we see is the same boss fights over and over, cut scenes, and slow motion screen shots of their new slow down mechanic.  they haven't shown what it is going to be like going from battle to battle? whats the progression going to look like? how is it going to flow? and most importantly... will it even be fun?   they havnt shown anything except for things to make us lose our collective shit with hype?

* The game records how much materia you use or expose Cloud to Mako, making his eyes glow brighter. (Achievement)

The only thing extra is the Cloud figurine and the Carbuncle DLC? Or is there more?

That's $250 more dollars for the figurine and a DLC that will undoubtedly be available eventually. Not confirmed but that's what they did with Final Fantasy XIV exclusive pre-order content.

So is it really just the figurine for $250? I would understand someone buying it if they're into collecting those things but it's a lot extra for $250.

Even if the Carbuncle DLC is say, $25, it would still be a lot for a figurine like that, no? I am however a completionist in FF games and I definitely want a physical copy.

So if Square Enix said there's no other way to get the Carbuncle DLC other than from Digital Deluxe or 1st Class, that would be disappointing. I guess then I could technically buy both the physical and deluxe edition, right? Would that work on PS4? It would be around $160.

I just HIGHLY doubt they'd make Carbuncle an entirely exclusive DLC unless I missed something.

P.s.: I would never judge anyone for getting the 1st Class Edition. The figure looks awesome and if I still collected those sort of things, I would totally be trying to get out the wait list.",0

So IF the next trailer heavily features the Shinra HQ as rumor has it , I'd put in a few seconds long shot of Hojo's laboratories, showing different specimen in cages. And one of those specimen would be Red XIII.

1) Shinra music is back. It sounds ominous, dark, industrial, as it should.
2) The battle theme part with violins fits so well and gives the trailer a strong dramatic vibe
3) You can see Aerith looking for Cloud's help, then Sephiroth for a brief moment, then flowers falling. This is a foreshadowing of her destiny.

622,"the multi part structure is probably the smartest move they have done in yearsby they i mean square enix/the FF team(s)

a few reasons for this; i try to be brief :P

firstely: for some reason they seem to be scared to make their games too long now a days, maybe its been a criticism towards the series,  i don't know.. so they definitely sacrifice story and other content to be able to keep the games at a ""reasonable"" length.. it takes about as long to play through FFIX as it does XIII(if you play casually) but its takes a whole lot longer to do anything in XIII, resulting in large parts of the lore and secondary plot to be told through the log(or whatever it was called). oh and yeah we can't forget about the corridors :P this game has now over world whatsoever..

and with XV, to balance out the massive open world and  loads of optional content they made it the shortest main campaign in FF history.. and had to fill out the story with a CG movie, a 4 episode anime, an audio drama, 4 story DLC, a multiplayer expansion so on and on and on (more on that later)

secondly: they really want to please everyone and have kinda made it a habit of fixing things retroactively, with XIII, they realized XIII-2 a few years after and it pretty much fixed all the things people had complained about, like the corridors and super linearity, with XV they released a literal shit ton of patches and story DLC, they even made polls for fans on what they wanted.. its a bit insane.. im glad they did thought because i love XV..and now with the KH3 DLC they seem to be doing the same thing..its not a bad thing to listen to fans but it seems a little inconvenient to always work like that..

which brings me to why the multi part structure is a smart move on their part,

firstly(again): since they story is split up they don't have to sacrifice one thing to balance it with another, they can go in as deep as they did with the old games without it becoming one massive 100 hour+ campaign...they can also have a big world with loads of things to do without having to sacrifice the story

secondly: no one can complain that part one of the remake is unfinished :P (they probably will anyway) because what's not in part one will probably be in part two, and they can also fix any complaints fans might have in the next part!

and lastly: (which i didn't address above) having multiple parts means more time on the project,  i think we already see the result of this in the trailers for FF7R, the level of polish is crazy for a FF game!

Obviously i know their rivalry is the crux of the entire story but i always felt like they could have expanded on how the rest feel about and view him and to have their own little moments with him. Especially Tifa who deserves to get some licks in against him...seeing as he destroyed her entire town and almost killed her. 

One idea i had is when Cloud is going through it in Mideel ""Sephiroth"" turns up in an attempt to kill him while he's vunerable and the rest of the party have to protect him. Imagine a scene where Sep is in a 3 on 1 fight with Cid, Vincent and Yuffie? They could go balls to the wall with fight choreography there. Sep then works his way through the party until it's just Tifa standing in front of Cloud alone protecting him and she goes super sayian trying to stop him. The drama. The Feels. The Intensity.

645,I have a theory about why FF7 remake will be episodic.So maybe people have pointed this out before but I do not know if I am the only one to come up with this. So i have thought it was interesting how ff7 remake is coming out just as the ps5 is around the corner. Which makes me seriously wonder(I have no proof or anything of this and maybe someone knows something I do not) but what if they making this game episodic because only the midgar part of the game could actually function on the ps4. So they decided oh lets just focus on the midgar part and then release the rest of the game on the ps5. I am not saying its a bad thing btw if anything it could very well give us an amazing game. As they could seriously create something amazing on the ps5 and if they do it in episodes it could just allow them to create a ton of content and create something truly massive when all episodes are out. (I do think the rest of the game/episodes will come out on ps5 as again the ps4 may not be able to handle what the devs have in mind for ff7 remake after midgar). Does anyone agree with my theory has been pointed out before is there stuff I am missing I am curious what you all think?,0

My hopes for outfits for Cloud

1. Advent children (maybe after beating the game)
2. Parka or some fur coat for the snow area (or something similar to what snowboards wear ;)
3. Obviously a Shinra soldier uniform
4. Asian style kimono / samurai gear for Wutai
5. A nice suit for the date with Aerith
6. Probably some cross game promotion like a Assassins creed Viking outfit)
7. Something dope for the end game / North Crater finale.

I left out the cross dressing because that’s most likely going to be an option.

But usually when I watched them I was out or at work and just watched with the sound off. Today I went back and watched them with the sound on and I noticed that the music that plays in the background is a remade version of ""Mark of a Traitor"" or the song that plays in Corel. Obviously this song doesn't play in Midgar. But then why would they remake it now? Only thought I had is that maybe there's a Barret flashback at some point. I linked to the post I heard the song in. What do you think?

Also if you search the FF7R Instagram feed there's a video that talks about Tifa's battle mechanics and the music that plays on that post is a remix of the original battle theme that sounds like something that could potentially be used in the fight up the pillar. Link to this one below. Just my two cents.

For example, I feel like the Tiny Bronco sequence will need to be reworked somehow.  It won't make much sense to borrow a small single-seater plane to ferry a party of 6 or 7 to the other continent.  Will they make the Bronco a bigger plane?  Will it be a different type of flying vehicle?

662,"Clouds ultimate weapon is the [upgraded] Buster SwordThe Remake sword is a hybrid between the sword zack had in CC/AC and the original. As discussed before, Zacks golden hilt is likely encased by the riveted hilt we see regularly. (Possibly damaged in Zacks final fight and repaired [cheaply] on Clouds arrival in Midgar)

If recent games are anything to go by, and sqaure chose for weapons to get subtle design changes as you upgrade them, I bet you have the option to repair the orignal hilt and remove the steal bracket/bolts to reveal the gold detailing. 

It may even make for a cool cut scene/ secret battle. When its re-revealed to Cloud a vivid yet incoherent flashback plays out - one whereby he takes part in a battle in his own head with a dark haired stranger he doesnt quite recognize, winning results in the player obtaining his ultimate weapon for part 1.

When it comes to the FF7-Remake,not only don't I remember Nobuo-san's name ever being mentioned officially,if you look at the following offical staff list , the music/sound section is not even mentioned.

Now I know in all probability that Uemastu is back for the remake...but the silence is nontheless a bit strange don't you think? Amidst all the interview snippets surrounding the game's nostalgia and given by Nomura/Kitase,I would have thought Nobuo would have made an appearance too...or if not him then at least some mention of a different composer?

697,"Character Swapping in CombatIf we assume the full team for part 1 will be Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aerith and Red, do you think there will be in battle character swapping similar to FFX? If we assume you can only have 3 characters on the battlefield at any given time I wonder if it would be possible to have an extra command to swap Aerith out for Red or something like that. I would personally love to see such a system implemented so I don't necessarily have to lock myself in to just 3 party members like I always did with the original. What are your thoughts?",0

699,"Disappointed with how the game is marketed.Just wanted to have my voice heard, because I'm a true fan of the game. I spent countless hours as a child playing it. Picked it up a few times as an adult, didn't forget it, and generally I am very appreciative that it exists.

The first time I heard about this remake, I jumped up and down like crazy. The other people in my workplace thought I was going nuts. And now... I will not buy this.

I remember that as a kid it cost me something like \~40 euro (approximately, since I can't quite remember and it was in drachmas anyways) for what would eventually be hundreds of hours of quality entertainment. Picked the game, put it in the console and was immediately immersed in a new world. No adds, no waiting, didn't have to choose different packages. Pure excellence. But now buying games has turned into a nightmare.

I can not stand it. It' being going on for too long. I want to support the industry. But only if the industry respects me. Stop forcing exclusive DLCs and promotions and ""services"". I would gladly pay double the price I used to, since industry costs have gone up. But make it a fair deal. No gameplay altering exclusives, no way.

If we keep buying it they will keep doing it. We have to play our part. Either they stop it themselves or we take control of the situation. It's a matter of principles. As much as I am begging to play this, I am not throwing my principles away in order to do so.

Here's an example of fighting against this new trend, that happened to me recently.  I preordered RE 2 remake because I was cautiously optimistic based on what I'd seen. When I realized that the preorder exclusives were not just skins but actually different weapons that affect gameplay, I immediately asked and received a full refund. About three months later, they added all the DLCs to the store and the game had a sale. I bought it again. All in all, the company simply lost money from this practice. My patience off and I enjoyed the game in the end.

In a similar fashion, I am not buying FF VII. If they want to add all gameplay related DLC later in a fair price and in a transparent manner, then we 're good. If not, it's their loss.",0

701,"I don't remember if the Zolom appears in every FF but I'm sure in FF7 it was slightly cooler than its other appearances.Also since its called a Midgar Zolom how would you guys feel about it being in Midgar this time? Or just outside as a super boss? I ask because there will probably be rideable chocobos in Midgar this time and we needed the chocobo to outrun it back in the day. However, if it's not in Midgar but in the same marsh it was in, in the og how should that be done now? Should it still chase us? And should it be bigger than any zoloms that were in other games? And how much should they put into the scene that shows one impaled in the remake?

703,"What's your vision of Red XIII? (playstyle wise)I see Red XIII being a Tanky (2nd best tank, behind barrett) somewhat offensive, CC support. 

I see him being being a fairly good tank, just not as strong defensive wise as barrett... but he'll be able to buff allies and debuff enemies through various Howl options... his CC would come from his ability to pounce enemies.... maybe being able to knock down and pin down smaller enemies while he bites them or possibly holding down a bigger enemies arm/ leg leaving them with no mobility/ distracted trying to get Red XIII off... 

That's just my vision of how he'll play, because currently we have 1 tank (barrett) and 1 support (Aerith) I think Red XIII would make a great option to mix both styles into a single character. 

What's your dream playstyle for Red XIII?",0
704,"Would anyone be able to animate the last screenshots that we saw ?Like, you know, the screenshot with Aerith looking in the distance. The remake of the old picture but withtout the highwind.

I'll be joining the PC Master Race in September, and abandoning console gaming behind, and I'd be extremely disappointed if they didn't release this on PC. Given how much this project is costing and the overall scope of it. I don't think Square can afford to ignore PC for very long (even if the game is just exclusive to console for a year, I can wait). 

I think the thing that irritates me is the fact that Square's done timed exclusives in the past and they've always been transparent about it.

Thoughts?",0
712,"FF7R Deluxe Edition Preorder Debit AttemptsAround on the subreddit I saw many posts about people receiving emails from Sqaure about a debit attempt coming on the 4th of this month. The first email I had received was in the same vein as those who ordered the 1st Class Edition, that this would be one of many attempts and if the funds could not be taken this time around then they would try on another date. I received that email 3 days ago. Earlier this morning, 4:22am Eastern Time, I received a second email from Square saying that the coming 4th would be the *only* debit attempt and if the funds could not be withdrawn then my preorder would be cancelled. Did anyone else here who ordered the Deluxe edition directly from Square receive this email as well, or am I one of the only people that actually ordered this version from directly from them?

Said email read:

*Thank you for your preorder of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - DELUXE EDITION \[PS4\]. We are pleased to announce that we will soon be preparing your order for shipment. As part of this preparation, we will begin charging for preorders on 2019-12-04 09:00 using the payment details that you provided upon checkout.*

*Please verify that you have sufficient funds available for the payment option you selected during the pre-order process. If your payment cannot be charged successfully, then your order will be cancelled.*

Thankfully, even with Black Friday just having past and Christmas coming up I still have the funds for the $91 withdrawl, but I certainly am not the majority.

P.S. Because I know there are assholes on Reddit. Yes, I know Gamestop and Amazon and such have the deluxe edition as well, but I don't have a nearby Gamestop and Amazon doesn't have the greatest track record on fulfilling deluxe editions of games plus UPS sucks ass where I live in the winter so I sucked up the shipping cost to get it via USPS from Square.

714,"SE caught me by surprise with email, had pre-ordered 1st Class Edition, and Customer Service screwing up my order WTFFirst of, why?! I've bought things off of their website with no issues whatsoever, and since this is the remake most of us FF 7 fans anticipated, I'd figure I would go all out and get the 1st Class Edition (I rarely buy CEs, but this is FF 7 we're talking about). I had pre-ordered in advance using PayPal as a payment method since that is how I do all of my online orders. 

However, I get the email saying they are starting charges early in December at the worst possible time and I go to edit my payment method and PayPal isn't listed as an option. Next thing I knew, I check my bank account and see that money was pulled out of my bank account. I clearly had set my pre-order to charge through PayPal (my credit card is linked to that). 

I contact Customer Service and explained the situation, but they told me that I could change the payment method and they called me by a different name (My name isn't Brittany, lmao). ""But, you guys charged my debit card and I specifically didn't want that."" I don't get how they can be so incompentent. I am waiting for a response back from them and hope this gets sorted out. At least with sites such as Amazon and even Gamestop, they don't charge you until after the item ships. I guess since Christmas is coming around, SE gotta cash in on that holiday spirit.",0

1. FEATURE - The FFVII Remake commercial has become known as the longest terrestrial TV commercial at 7 minutes long. There is a special edit available on the Square Enix YouTube channel including additional scenes.
2.  Anticipation is growing around the FFVII Remake due to positive reception at the Tokyo Game Show 2019, the first time there has been a stage show and gameplay demo in Japan. Today we are going to look at the visuals for Reno and Rude of the Shinra Company’s Turks, as well as Weapon Growth, Weapon Abilities and other new features of the Remake. 
3. Yellow blossoms on sale from the Flower Girl. Flowers of this type are said to stand for “Reunion”. 
4. An old church on the outskirts of the Sector 5 slums. The building is falling apart; abandoned after a Shinra Rocket crashed into it during a failed launch. One of the few places that flowers will grow in the otherwise desolate slums, Aerith comes to tend to them whenever she can.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  In FFVII Remake, you can improve the strength of your weapons by spending SP to unlock the potential of the Core Materia hidden within. The screenshot to the right is the upgrade screen for Cloud’s Buster Sword. It looks like lots of things are possible, from increasing stats like Attack Power, Magic Power and Max HP, to increasing the number of Materia Slots. Furthermore, each weapon has it’s own unique abilities. Your proficiency with these abilities raises the more you use them, and once your proficiency maxes out, you learn the ability and can use it regardless of what weapon you have equipped. 
2.  With the Materia System you can use all kinds of Magic and Commands by equipping Materia into slots in your weapons and armour. The newly unveiled “Fire” Materia lets you use magic with Fire affinity, evolving from Fire, to Fira, to Firaga. The Independent “Assess” Materia lets you pinpoint the enemy’s characteristics, affinities, weaknesses etc, and press the advantage in battle. 
3.  SUMMONS - If you equip Summon Materia you can call on a Summon during certain battles when the Summon Gauge appears. They fight automatically until the Summon Gauge depletes, or players can use ATB charges to command a Summon to use special abilities. When they disappear they unleash their ultimate ability, dealing massive damage to the enemy. Today we are introducing the super-cute Chocobo &amp; Moogle! 
4.  CHOCOBO &amp; MOOGLE - Riding on his buddy Chocobo, Moogle travels the world. He might look cute, but he shows his enemies no mercy when he drops the “Mog Bomb”! 
5.  ULTIMATE ABILITY - Chocobo &amp; Moogle’s ultimate ability is called ‘Stampede’. They run down the enemy with a herd of chocobos! 
6.  ABILITY - MOG-BOMB! *(Props to kry0sis for this translation!)*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Combat in the Remake uses RPG style commands as a base, with Action style elements blended in. Pressing the square button marked ‘Attack’ will perform a regular attack, pressing repeatedly will link into a combo, and holding down square will unleash an area based attack. On top of that, pressing triangle allows you to use a character’s unique ability. Let’s have a look at Cloud’s.
2.  Cloud’s unique triangle move is the ability to change between the more balanced ‘Operator Mode’ and the more aggressive ‘Punisher Mode’. Once in Punisher Mode, movements become less responsive, but ‘Attack’ changes to ‘Strong Attack’ and deals more damage. 
3. 'Attack' in Operator Mode changes to ‘Strong Attack’ in Punisher Mode. It looks like sacrificing speed for stronger attacks leaves you vulnerable to taking damage yourself. 
4. ENJOY THE ORIGINAL COMMAND SYSTEM OF FFVII THROUGH CLASSIC MODE - In addition to Easy and Normal game modes, there is also a Classic Mode. Players can battle in just the same way as in the Original, but with revamped graphics. Characters perform actions and fill their ATB gauges automatically, while the player simply chooses whether to spend those charges on Magic, Abilities, Items etc. What’s more, you have the option to take control of your characters back at any time just by using the controller. You can even change between any game modes at any time.
5.  THE NEW ‘REMADE’ BATTLE SYSTEM EXPLAINED 
6.  BLADE BURST - A ranged attack that unleashes a magical beam from your sword.
7.  TRIPLE SLASH - Cuts enemies in the surrounding area for three successive hits. Your efficiency increases by attacking multiple enemies.
8. ALL THOSE MINIGAMES ARE ALSO GETTING A REMAKE! - One of the biggest charms of FFVII was the huge variety of minigames. In this new version they have been given the ‘Remake’ treatment too, with new minigames being included alongside the nostalgic classics.
9.  It wasn’t in the original, but you can now play darts using the board in Seventh Heaven. 
10. The Motorbike chase looks incredible! The scene where you are being pursued by Shinra looks great and fun to play. You get to ride alongside Jessie no less!

1. Originally released on the PlayStation, FFVII is being remade using realistic modern day graphics techniques. But it’s not just the game - the character artwork released alongside it is also being remade. Today we are introducing Aerith and Barret’s character artwork from the Remake. In addition, we’ll look at the Sector 5 Slums as an example of the revamped locations, and reintroduce ourselves to the members of AVALANCHE as presented by their voice actors.
2.  THE WORLD OF FFVII REIMAGINED 
3.  LOCATION - AERITH’S HOUSE - A tiny cottage tucked away in a corner of the Sector 5 Slums. Aerith and her mother Elmyra live here together. They grow a variety of flowers in the garden, which Aerith sells to the people of Midgar every day.
4.  The crystal clear water flowing down the mountainside and the quaint buildings in the background make for a beautiful scene you wouldn’t expect to find in the slums. 
5.  AVALANCHE - STANDING UP TO SHINRA - The Anti-Shinra group Avalanche claim that “Mako is the life energy of the planet, and Shinra are draining the life of the planet away”. There are many Avalanche cells in existence, and the Midgar branch run by Biggs, Wedge, Jessie and their leader Barret is one of the most active, never shying away from taking direct action.
6. BIGGS - SAKAGUCHI SHUUHEI - “Us, a burden?! Don’t say stuff like that!” - A quick witted team player, Biggs is in charge of tactics and strategy. Following the lead of hot-headed Barret, he takes a calmer approach. A bit of a neat-freak, he loves cleaning and showers.
7. WEDGE - ASAI TAKAYUKI - “Maybe there’ll be Pizza. The Midgar Special."" - Broad-faced and kind-hearted, Wedge excels at gathering information and diplomacy. He also fills the crucial role of taste-taster at Seventh Heaven. As the level-headed mediator of the group, he is indispensable to the team.
8. JESSIE - MORIYA SATOMI - “Confidence and Stupidity are two sides of the same coin. Which are you full of?” - From bombs to fake IDs, Jessie is in charge of procuring and preparing essential equipment for missions. A skilled engineer, she earns funds for the group by selling water purification equipment and other machinery. Kind and caring, she is a sucker for pretty boys.

1. RENO - FUJIWARA KEIJI - Reno is a member of the Investigation Sector of the Department of General Affairs - better known as the Turks. Sporting flaming red hair and a cynical smile, he is constantly laid back. Using his agility to toy with his opponents, he employs a variety of attacks using special issue weaponry.
2. “Enjoying your work no matter what - that’s the mark of a professional.""
3. The Shinra corporation control the world using Mako Energy. The Investigation Sector of the Department of General Affairs - or the Turks - specialize in covert missions. This small group of elites handles everything from SOLDIER recruitment and VIP escorts to spying and assassinations. Behind the veil of Shinra’s success, the hand of the Turks moves in the shadows.
4. RUDE - KUSUNOKI TAITEN - A member of the Turks and Reno’s partner. Bald and always wearing sunglasses, this giant of a man carries out his duties directly with no idle banter. Carrying no weapons, Rude fights using only unarmed techniques and brute force.
5. “I’ll get even for what you did to my partner.""

He's a character who's got well rounded stats, and can really go any direction.

The mobile games have a thing about making him a buffing/supporting character with things like Lunatic High or Howling moon, which works well because of his Red Mage-esque role in the original, but also it seems like a waste to not have him be a physical attacker due to how fun/different it is to play as a beast, and it's not like he's a bad physical attacker anyways.

I want to see what others think we could be seeing in the remake, buffing howls? Somebody once mentioned him possibly clinging onto larger enemies like he did in Advent Children and gnawing at them doing damage over time, or possibly pinning/trapping an enemy as an immobilizer? Or will he just end up sled fanging around into people at mach speed like in the original? They have a lot of options with this character and I'm interested to see where they take it",0

734,"Wutai in the remakeSomething that has always seemed a bit silly to me (although obviously forgivable) in the original ff7 was the idea of the war between Shinra and Wutai. 

Shinra has an army, huge robots and other mad technology and weapons.

Wutai is a village, with 5 warriors guarding a pagoda and that’s pretty much it.

If there was a war between these it would last 30 seconds (and I’m being generous to Wutai there).

So what if, in the remake, Wutai was a huge city/state in itself, to rival Midgar. Except maybe it’s ff7’s USSR to Shinra/Midgar’s USA. A rival power in the world but second place in that respect. And post war it’s become all run down and miserable.

It would add to the believability for this situation - although it’d create a problem for the developers having to create another huge city and fill it with content.

I do wonder what the world map will be like in the remake. 

Surely it’s not going to be one big city and then just a handful of small villages on the whole world like the original? Or will the world be expanded with more cities and much bigger towns for realism?

Has there been any word from official channels on this? And what does everyone think?",0

I changed my payment method to a maxed out credit card and will change it later, closer to the Jan 17th date. That gives me a month and a few weeks which is a lot better than being charged fully next week (and only giving us a week notice to come up with the money).

748,"Equipment &amp; Character Growth Recap&amp;#x200B;

**EQUIPMENT &amp; STATS**

&amp;#x200B;

* Character each have 3 equipment slots : Weapon, Armor and Accessory.
* Weapons influence stats. No confirmation that Armor and Accessories do as well, but it is expected.

[Weapon, Armor and Accessory slots](https://preview.redd.it/othpvykjpi141.png?width=342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32638fc5cc0c2d2a2c115140615333bfa42e9371)

&amp;#x200B;

* Stats are called Attributes. They are :
   * HP
   * MP
   * Attack
   * Defense
   * Magic Attack
   * Magic Defense
   * Strength (physical attack)
   * Magic
   * Vitality (physical defense)
   * Spirit (magical defense)
   * Luck
   * Speed
* Each character can level up with EXP, receiving stats bonus every time. No confirmation that EXP is tallied automatically like in the OG, but it would make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

[Attributes](https://preview.redd.it/s9q0p9dwpi141.png?width=340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1341464817ecc5d9f7b257ec526fd0a9f8b58c9)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**WEAPON &amp; ABILITIES**

&amp;#x200B;

* Equipping a weapons gives you access to its Abilities. When the player uses a specific Ability in battle it fills the Proficiency bar of that ability over time ; when full, this Ability can now be use with any new weapon equipped. 100% Proficiency also grants bonus effect to that ability in battle.
   * This means that the classic Attack and Limit Break commands have been broken down into various Abilities all linked to weapon growth.

&amp;#x200B;

[Focused Thrust ability unlocked in the Buster Sword, currently at max Proficiency with  \\""Stagger a foe\\"" bonus effect in battle](https://preview.redd.it/wlm1oz0kqi141.png?width=246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0261250f1d6b13d07114a1b6bf6f8f6e3bc0688a)

&amp;#x200B;

* Weapon can evolve with SP. No confirmation on how SP are received, but we know from the demo that you don't get SP from battle, so I assume you get SP at Level Up, hence from tallied EXP.
* Since new Materia slots can be added to a weapon, its appearance will probably change when that happens.
* Each weapons has different Cores, each Cores granting a different sets of skills. The only example given so far is the Buster Sword, which shows :
   * Core 1 = \[STATS BUFFS\] 4/4: The SP cost is not showing underneath since all skills are already unlocked.
   * Core 2 = \[???\] 1/4 : It cost 6 SP to unlock the next skill. (new regular Attack/Limit Breaks?)
   * Core 3 = \[???\] 4/6 : It cost 8 SP to unlock the next skill. (new Materia slots?)

&amp;#x200B;

[Before spending SP : there are 15 SP in the bank, the Buster Sword is at level 3\/5 with 35 attack stat : its Core 1 is fully unlocked, Core 2 is showing no skill unlocked, Core 3 is showing 3 skills unlocked.](https://preview.redd.it/7xr2x9diri141.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d3eae420ef27561d4807665c0887f8a30a4d844)

[After spending SP : Buster Sword attack stats is now 43 and there is only 1 SP left in bank, meaning the player has unlocked a skill in Core 2 \(-6 SP\) and a skill in Core 3 \(-8 SP\). One of these unlock granted a new Materia slot to the weapon.](https://preview.redd.it/pexg8z6eri141.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56bd32beafe48059816732733efe553eb6166014)

&amp;#x200B;

**MATERIA**

* Weapons and Armors have Materia slots. Equipping Materia grants Spells and other Commands in battle. 
* Each character as one Summon Materia slot available, independent from the Weapon slots but showing at the end of that line in the menu. So far, it seems this value cannot be increased, but who knows.
* Combining Materia by placing them in joined slots in Weapon or Armor can grant special effects (only example given so far is Ice + Elemental in Weapon slot).

&amp;#x200B;

Square Enix store will be collecting payments for FF7R. Few of us here were caught by surprise because the game is still 3 months away from release, and yet, having to front up payments during the holiday season with **only a week's notice**. I ordered the First Class Edition so it's a big hit on the budget.

**SE's response?** ~~They recommend cancelling if I am finding difficulties to fulfill the transaction. So much for taking care of their ""valued customers"".~~  [https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/e5qiin/se\_store\_update\_yay\_they\_are\_taking\_payments\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/e5qiin/se_store_update_yay_they_are_taking_payments_on/)

Oh well, things happen. I'll just go reprioritize my December budget.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Just got an email from them saying they will start collecting payment for FF7 Remake pre-orders... 3 months ahead of release date. (I pre-ordered the First Class Edition)

Anyone got a similar email, and is there any way to ask to them and have this pre-order billed at a much later, and realistic timeframe?

Other than proxy-shopping in Japan, I ever experienced full payments on pre-orders are required this far in advance... definitely caught me by surprise and this is going to affect my Christmas budget :(

**EDIT WITH FULL EMAIL MESSAGE BELOW:**

&gt;Dear {-------------},  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your pre-order of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - 1ST CLASS EDITION \[PS4\]!   
&gt;  
&gt;Pre-orders are typically debited 2 to 3 weeks before the shipment date. However, some customers have experienced payment rejections in the past due to insufficient funds or expired credit cards before payment processing leading to pre-order cancellations.  
&gt;  
&gt;To ensure there are sufficient funds in your account, the payment processing attempt for FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - 1ST CLASS EDITION \[PS4\] will start earlier than usual.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please expect the first debit attempt to happen during the first week of December. If this attempt is unsuccessful, there will be additional debit attempts throughout the next few months. Upon successful payment, your order will be secured and is expected to be shipped near the release date of March 3rd, 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you would like to expedite this payment process and avoid any potential delays, you can pay for your pre-order now by visiting the PURCHASE HISTORY page below, click “MANAGE” for your order and then click “DEBIT NOW”.   
&gt;  
&gt;***(Link to PURCHASE HISTORY)***  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for supporting the Square Enix Store!

**EDIT #2: Email their support team, waiting for response. Will report back.**

**EDIT #3: Just to be sure, I ""updated"" my credit card info (not issuing a debt) with them. I am using the same credit card which was never expired or changed since E3. Below is the message on their site after updating my payment:**

&gt;THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRE-ORDER!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for purchasing from Square Enix Store! Your pre-order {--------------} is being processed and we will be sending an e-mail confirmation shortly.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Best regards,  
&gt;  
&gt;Square Enix Store Team

**EDIT #4:** Customer Support replied with a **NOPE**. Basically saying pay next week, or their *recommendation* to us the ""valued customer"" is to cancel the order.

**EDIT #5 (Dec 3rd):** SE sent a response email saying they will now collect payments on January 22, 2020 instead. Great news all around, and thanks to everyone raising this concern to them and very glad they listened! Can [see this post for followup details](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/e5qiin/se_store_update_yay_they_are_taking_payments_on/).

I think there's 4 possibilities here

1) character progression is not preserved through games, it just starts over

2) progression is preserved and if you grind to the maximum in the first game, you are already at the maximum level in later installments with no further progression

3) progression is preserved but sequels allow you to go further (possibly capping at level 300 with 99'999 hp instead of level 100 with 9'999)

4) Progression is reduced to a fraction, (possibly half?) i.e. if you were level 100 at the end of game one, you start at level 50 (with half the stats, including HP) in the second game

Red XIII, for example, his story is over halfway through Disc 1 (after Cosmo Canyon).

Cait Sith, didn't even seem to have a story and also doesn't seem to have any real explanation for what he is except a bunch of conjecture. My suggestion for him is saying he's a self-autonomous robot that Reeve can order what to do via his crown. It makes sense and fits in with his story. The reason I believe he should be self-autonomous is because of the temple of the ancients scene. Where he talks about his death and though another will come don't forget him. I think they should make a clear difference between version 1 and version 2. Cait Sith also feel could be the Vivi of FF7, pondering his own existence and if he has a soul.

762,"How will our progress be transferred over? And a ""HOT TAKE"" predictionNot sure if this was covered but I feel like if we can get an answer as to how or if our progress in part one will transfer over to part 2 that will give us an idea on how part 2 and other chapters will be given to us.

I know that it has been said that each part will be its own stand alone game BUT it would be a complete waste of time collecting the materia, gaining the skills, equipment etc. only to lose it in a new game. I feel like there is a strong possibility that these new chapters will be given to us in DLC form. When I look at how other games have used DLC in order to reinvent itself over the past few years I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. For example Destiny's expansion packs, Rainbow Six Siege and their new seasons with operators and new levels etc.

When I look at what we have been given as far as trailers, box art, gameplay etc. from a marketing standpoint it just does not seem feasible.

* As Square releases new chapters they would only be catering to a set audience. The only consumers open to buying part 2 would have to have already played part 1.
* If a consumer purchased part 2 before part 1 what equipment, materia etc. would they be given? What level would they start with?

As far as the release time frame, I'm calling it now, we will get a new chapter once every year. The DLC size will be huge and cost us roughly $30 each.

I could be wrong here but as I mentioned before I'm going off of feasibility as well as what we've seen done so far with other AAA titles and DLC. Thoughts?",0

768,"FF7 Remake - SKILL POINTS COSTHere is what I think the Skill point means in the 2 screenshots Square-Enix posted this week.

First, the Buster Sword starts with 2 slots and has 3 cores as shown above the ability preview window (B)

I believe beside each weapons in the Upgrade Weapon List...we can see the amount of SP available for that weapon (A)...Here, The Buster Sword has 15 SP left.

Then, In the Buster sword's upgrade Screen, we can now see the 3rd slot is unlocked AND the cores upgrades count changed as well. (C) With 1 SP left...Here's how it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we had 15 SP left :

Core 1 : 4/4 upgrades (cost unknown)

Core 2 : 0/4 upgrades (cost of 6 per upgrades...as shown in (C) under each cores)

Core 3 : 3/6 upgrades (cost of 8 per upgrades...as shown in (C) under each cores)

&amp;#x200B;

THEN,

&amp;#x200B;

When the Buster sword upgrade screen is shown afterward, we have only **1 SP** left right,

&amp;#x200B;

Core 1 : 4/4 upgrades (cost unknown)

769,"Negative Nancy moments.So, we are all enjoying  FFVII remakes news so far, and why not: the game looks good, reports of the demo are positive and it feels like the game is poised to deliver on a pretty big demand. Regardless of how each of us feel about hype, I think it is safe to say that the majority of the fans of the original game have a bunch of good will towards this game.

But of course, nothing is perfect, and there is no reason to expect FFVII remake to be as well, but instead of the major criticism people have brought up already, what would be your minor gripes you have about this game judging by what we know so far?

No need to go full blown of hate (I mean, if you want to, go ahead), but I'm curious to know what made people go ""humm, I don't know about this"" whenever reading about this upcoming game.

Myself, no difficulty mode harder than normal. of course they can unlock a harder one in new game plus, but from what people said so far, the game is too easy, and for a action orientated game to be easy can be a major downer, and if there is a hard mode to be unlocked, it still is a bummer to have to play 40+ hours for this.",0

I wanted to watch it again but then I told myself: a large portion of the remake is seeing the stuff u imagined as a kid in HD/4K. Trailers kinda spoil seeing it for the first time. So I wanna experience everything together, the gameplay, the music, the story, the familiar scenes, the expanded scenes.

I had a pretty simple idea for a hard mode that would be extremely easy to implement and I would like your opinions. Basically all it is, is normal mode, but the X button that lets you go into slow mo has a time limit. This would help make it close to the original. In the original there was ATB, but as you were going through the menus, the opponent had an opportunity to attack you. 

This would basically be the same. You go into slow mo mode, but it only lasts for a limited time. Once you are out, you still have the options available to select, but you are no longer in slow mo mode.",0

I'll concede that FFXV was pretty bad when it first came out, but that was only because it was incomplete. FFVII Remake Midgar is a complete game, they even said its 2 blueray discs worth of content, and now that FFXV has finally been completed with all the new DLC it's a really good and fun game, so by the time we reach the 5th part in the FFVII remake series it should be a really good game too.",0

I loved FF7's overworld! The stark contrast from Midgar caught me off guard, and that beautiful music perfectly reflects that awestruck feeling of seeing such a massive world full of natural wonders!


The most recent game in the series, Final Fantasy 15... Just doesn't strike that same feeling for me. It feels so much like I'm constantly trapped by cluttered objects in the environment, NPCs demanding I do sidequests to take me out of the game every two seconds, and while I think the visuals can be impressive, [it all just felt way too serious and over complicated to me. It didn't feel like there was an emphasis on how beautiful nature could be. It felt dead.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1976/1*ORn2DhKzEC1Spm7wxPcjbg.png)


I know the new render is meant to recreate an existing one, and there's a good chance that they haven't even finalized the overworld yet, but... I have to wonder if this render is meant to capture the scenic view and feeling they want to go for. I hope once you leave Midgar, instead of being presented with menus, complex maps, roads, an environment that tries too hard to be chaotic in shape to feel ""natural"", sidequests... You're given a wide, bright, open grassy field. In the distance you can see towns or other locations like the Chocobo barn you can get to if you run long enough. Enemies that'll occasionally attack you as you trek around... Very simple, but beautiful.


In a way, a very faithful recreation of the overworld from the original! Maybe plus a few more towns with more to do in them, the occasional tree, and the environments found in the original too. (Forests for example.) But for the most part, I'd love to see an overworld that's very focused! Simple, but pretty, and fun to traverse! I want the game to give you a feeling of a lack of civilization and a good sense of the beauty of nature, like this!


Anyways, do you all think this art might end up reflecting what the player might encounter when leaving Midgar, being close to what the original did and staying simple? Or do you think it'll be a lot more crowded and busy like in Final Fantasy 15?",0

784,"Theory: The Next Trailer Will Be Released on the December 3rdPeople have been wondering when the next trailer will be released and I've come to the conclusion that we could see it as soon as December 3rd for a few reasons.

• They seem to be gearing up for something major soon, the screenshot dump, the interviews with key staff members, the upcoming Famitsu article, the Animate deal, the snippets of a long interview with Kitase, etc..

• December 3rd is the 25th anniversary of the release of the original Playstation so I wouldn't be surprised if there are some announcements to celebrate the day and FF7R is the next major PS4 exclusive.

•December 3rd is also the date of the Playstation awards which it seems like Sony are going to put more focus on this year as it seems it will also be streaming in English this year.

• Atlus are also counting down to a major announcement about the western release on Persona 5 Royal on the same day.

786,"Choices and their impact in FF7RHi everyone !

I've been thinking a lot about the story in this remake, and how they could build an entire game in Midgar by satisfying both the old &amp; the new players.   
And I wanted to talk with you about something I would really love to see in the remake: the choices.

What I mean is that I recently finished The Witcher 3, and I loved really much to have many choices during all the story that would impact heavily and permanently some groups of population, villages, main characters...   
And even if I still regret some choices I've made, this game impacted me a lot emotionally because of those choices. 

Here is the thing, do you think that FF7R will have those choices during the story ?   
I don't remember anything about that in Square's communication, but if we have to spend an entire game in Midgar, it would be really disappointing to be driven all game long (even if there are side quests or whatever).  
I was also telling myself that The Witcher 3 has a really dark background and that it is easier in this game to have such hard choices with rude consequences.   
But in fact FF7 has also a dark background, and the Shinra or the Turks aren't people who hesitate about killing civilians or innocents. 

I imagined that &gt;!once you destroyed one or two reactors some people in the slums could begin to rebel against the authority of the shinra and you could maybe have the choice to help them or not, with a positive and a negative impact in both choices for example.!&lt;  
We could also make choices with Cloud to keep being an asshole who's just here for money or make him becoming someone who cares about the planet or Avalanche. It could impact the ""friendship"" with other members of the group in particular Barret.

Do you guys think it's possible and would you like to be able to impact the story in Midgar ?

802,"Weapons for CloudSo by looking at this ""Upgrade Weapons"" screen (yup we can upgrade our weapons, how fucking cool is that?!) it appears there will be, at least, 7 different weapons for Cloud. Nail Bat is confirmed (I know some of you were looking forward to this one) and the Iron Blade which seems to be a new one? I don't remember seeing it in the OG. So thoughts? Would you like more weapons or is 7 enough, considering we can upgrade them?

806,"Downside of current technology in games - Unpopular opinion, but please hear me out..\[11/29/2019 Update\]: thank you all for the feedback and responses. I've thoroughly enjoyed reading your thoughts on the matter and I'm glad we can discuss this openly without this post being down-voted to hell. Cheers. 

The trend of visual effects and/or realism in games today takes away the imaginative faculty.

That is not to say this direction is necessarily bad. However there is something in the brain that gets excited when it gets to make the connection for itself, instead of having it spoon fed. This is similar to when you read a book vs watching a movie.

The original FF7 game lacked facial expressions, voice acting, body language, and high resolution imagery. But that is not to say it wasn't there when we experienced the game. Instead these aspects manifested inside our own imagination, filling in the void with our own unique interpretation and experience which is what gave the title a lasting impression. I believe this is why a lot of fans have a personal connection to the(se) game when we first touched it; It was our imagined world.

Fast forward to today, these aspects of the characters/world are now filled-in given current generation technology. Our brains have also completed development and our ability to allow for divergent imagination deteriorate as we fill our heads with dogma and belief systems.  This leaves us little room for imagination, and this is part of the reason for why often remakes suffer backlash, which would give rise to the debates as to why some think &lt;insert character/element&gt; should look, sound, act, and why something is not ""canon"" etc etc. These elements which have been built over the years in your imagination has set a certain foundation and expectation for the remake, and anything that deviates from YOUR ""imagined"" experience from the original will completely shatter this foundation. For these reasons I believe SE attempting to recreate nostalgia in FF7 is very dangerous and unwise.",0
807,"My one concern about the remake: sidequests.I'm overall very excited and positive for the remake, everything that we've seen so far has gone far beyond any expectations that I could have had before. On the otherhand, I don't want to be overhyped and have ridiculous expectations so wanted to being up one concern I was having.

The main concern is that we're going from a section in the game where everything you do, for the most part, is quite significant and moving the story along. Iirc, there's not much in the way of side questing in the earlier part of the game. There are some things like when dressing cloud up (still part of the main story), honeybee inn but not any typical sidequests.

As the remake is looking to be more open world, I'm mostly worried about fetch quests and such. Ultimately FF7 was a narrative experience and that's really what has always stood out as the strength of the game. The amazing characters, world and story. Having side quests sounds like a lot of fun but then I'm also worried about it stunting the narrative and how the story flows. In the original the midgar section felt like it happened over the course of a few days and things really escalated quickly. The narrative will be fundamentally changed in some ways (which I'm not opposed to, and it won't tarnish the original as a masterpiece for me).

Mostly, this is just a concern that I'd like to keep in mind so I'm not blindsided by it when the game releases and have expectations too high (such as the sort of impossible seeming situation with the more open world while maintaining the original narrative pacing).

Would love to hear your opinions. What sort of side quests would you want? Do you think we'll have a lot of extra trivial ones like fetch quests? Cheers for reading. 

I also get that the original midgar section, from what I read/heard, was meant to be more expanded but it was a resource intensive part to product (wasn't it like 10-15% of the game narratively, and timewise on a typical playthrough, while being closer to like 40% of the field backgrounds for the entire game?). For some reason I really enjoy the original midgar section's pacing and how it felt like stuff was really happening with no real downtime until you finally get out of midgar and get some time to recollect yourself. All that said, it's one of the absolute coolest and more interesting settings in any game ever and getting to explore more of it will be incredible.",0

818,"What if Sephiroth...So I put this up as a spoiler because there are a lot of gamers who haven't played the original.  

My thought is a liberty Square Enix could take with the series.  In the original, at the end of disc one if I remember right, Sephiroth took a hundred foot high leap of faith and used Aerith as a cushion to land safely with his sword in her back.  But, the original intent from the creators was to kill Barrett, but decided Aerith would be a more emotionally devastating decision.  It would be interesting to see if the person who eats a sword is the one you take for a ride on the gondola in the Golden Saucer.  The one you earn karma points with.  I think that would be an interesting take and a shocker for many of us who played the original.  To see Yufi or Tifa bite it.",0

823,"Which minor characters are you looking forward to seeing?We already know that characters like Biggs, Wedge, and particularly Jessie will be getting more attention in FFVIIR than they did in the original game, but what about the other minor characters in the Midgar section? For me, there are 3 in particular that I hope we see in an expanded role in Remake:

* Elmyra: Aerith's adoptive mother, Elmyra basically exists for the purposes of (A) giving an exposition dump about Aerith's true nature, and (B) giving Barrett a way to remove Marlene from the picture so he can run off and save the planet. I imagine she will serve a similar role in the Remake, but she could also be expanded in two interesting ways. One is to give us more context on the war with Wutai - Elmyra's husband was a soldier who was killed in action during that conflict, and Aerith herself delivers the news of his death. Elmyra could help flesh out the details of what happened during the war years and how it affected the common people. The second is to give more details on Aerith's young life, what kind of strange abilities she displayed, and her character in general - particularly her strange relationship with Tseng.
* Johnny: One of the patrons of Seventh Heaven, and a (not so) secret admirer of Tifa, Johnny encounters the party several times throughout the game and provides something of a running gag in the narrative. He is more interesting in the English version because, due to some mistranslated text, it seems like he has a prior relationship with Cloud and Tifa from back home in Nibelheim, which would complicate the muddled backstories before Cloud and Tifa work out the truth ever further. Whether or not SE decided to adopt this interpretation in Remake (I personally doubt it, but it would certainly be interesting), I hope to see Johnny appear in some capacity.
* Reeve and Scarlet: I'm cheating a little here, but during the original Midgar section Reeve is barely present, appearing only twice if memory serves me correctly - once to protest a certain horrific action of President Shinra's, and once in the boardroom scene.  During that second scene he and Scarlet are told they will divide a budget between them, in their respective capacities as Head of Urban Development and Head of Weapons Development. It would be interesting to see these two morally opposed characters interacting one-on-one, and also see Reeve's gradual shift away from working for change within the system to outright resistance. Also just more of Scarlet because she is deliciously evil - like a cyberpunk Cruella DeVil.

What do you guys think? Who are you looking forward to seeing in March?",0

838,"[POSSIBLE SPOILERS] Thoughts upon Red XIII participation in Remake Part 1(saying POSSIBLE SPOILER in the title so I don't have to mark most of the content as spoiler)

I caught myself wondering how they would fit Red XIII into the Remake Part 1...  
I mean, I think it would be a HUGE disappointment if he didn't show up at all, so I don't think Square is going this path.  
Yet, I don't really see them, or any other gaming company, creating a whole playable character if the game is going to end in, like, the next 30 minutes. It is simply too much work for very little rewards.

So, I think it will be one of the following:

a) The game doesn't end after escaping Shinra Tower. If the game goes all the way to Kalm and beyond, it makes more sense to include him as a playable character;  
b) Red XIII as a non-playable character. That would still be a great disappointment, but possible in a project-wise sense;  
c) Red XIII joining the group in a new mission BEFORE Shinra Tower. That would be really NEAT, as it would allow players to have him as a character before what we think will be the ""Point of no return"" of this game, being able to explore Midgar with him, and also allowing many more interactions between characters. I really hope they go this way.",0

Obviously cloud dual wielding is nothing new but it could be cool in game. Also maybe denzel from AC could be a party member since he would be a tad older? Maybe even marlene? Lol Maybe the og cast can all get big changes in how they look? We could play in a world where things are a little more built up?

858,"The world mapAnother OP posted something about part 2's map and I replied to it with the following, but it got kind of long so I figured I would present it as it's own post, let me know your thoughts:

It will be very interesting, because FF15 was described to have a HUGE map, but if you really think about it, the entire Lucis ""continent"" is about 10 x 10 miles, really, more like a small island really. If you just ran with noct, you could get from one side to the other in about an hour, he runs about 12mph. If you think about the FF7 map and the way the map made you feel, the space between the towns felt huge! how much distance is between midgar and kalm, right, you figure maybe a few miles, well if you're running, then it might take 15 minutes to get from midgar to kalm, think about how much scenery, how many enemies will be in that range.

This is going to be more exaggerated when you get the airship, you figure this thing flies fast right? But realistically, you're not going to be able to fly around the world in 30 seconds like you could in the original. Not only is that bad for loading the surrounding areas, and what you see below, but it's just not realistic. So comparing FF15 again, the first continent of FF7 is about a third of all land mass in the FF7 world, that's huge, and would likely have to be at least similar or even much bigger than the entire island of lucis.

You figure all that in 100GB of data. And what of subsequent parts, unless they make the previous parts unexplorable, which I can't imagine, that whole map would be accessible on each part after 2. So unless they do some voodoo shit with compression and processing, part 2 and on is going to be HUUUUUGGEEE! Just mass amounts of data, and with PS5 going to have Solid state drives, which are more expensive, and you figure maybe they come with either 500GB or a 1TB of space, The entire FF7 Remake parts combined may well take up ALL the space on your PS4 or PS5 Drive. I'm thinking they are going to have to get creative in a logistical sense, because the world they are planning on making seems like something that should be run from a $10000 server rig, not a gaming console.",0
859,"7R world map (part 2 on)So I've been of the mind that there was no way a full FF7 map would be possible on the PS4 and that part 2 onward would have to be PS5 exclusives but Death Stranding has begun to change my mind about that. The map in DS is huge with a major focus on exploration, something 7R will have much less of. So I think we may actually get to see all parts of 7R release for the PS4. DS has made me really optimistic about this aspect since I've been really turned off by the possibility of having to buy a PS5 just for the continuations of 7R.",0

Or Cait Sith can switch to a mode where the cat hops off to let other characters ride on his shoulders to fight on top? ( Last idea is a bit wacky but yea).

Edit: So apparently only cloud has a different stance to switch to so let's just discuss different special abilities that each character might get.

881,"Speculation on how Knights of the Round will work - Share your ideas.So like, KotR is probably like on a lot of peoples mind when it comes to summons in the Remake.

Considering all the changes to the summon system, how will the blingiest chad and his bros work?

I got a few ideas.

1. The final knight, also known as King Arthur will be summoned as the main body. The King will be the primary summon on the field and periodically, the other knights in order will appear to do an attack. This will repeat until all 12 knights have come and gone. Then the last final attack will have all the knights appear around the King and the final attack is performed.
2. Similar to the first idea, but instead of the King staying permanently, each knight in order only appears for a set time to perform attacks. This continues until the 13th or the King appears, attacking for a bit until the timer runs out and the King uses Excalibur or something like Ultimate End from FFXIV.
3. Again, going off from the first idea, the King is the primary summon, but this time, you actually have to use your ATB to activate the other knights. Though this one, I think will have a lot of kinks to get it working right. For example, will there be enough time to use all 12 within the summon time? Will your ATB fill enough times to use 12 abilities?

Basically the idea is to have all 13 knights appear before the final attack, instead of having a 90 second final attack animation.",0

Does anyone get the feeling we're still missing a key piece of the gameplay? Here's what I've got a good grasp of so far:

* Characters (minus my red boi)
* Battle system
* General story (obviously piecing things together from trailers and going off knowledge of the original)

OK. All good. 

But what happens *between* all that? Will there be an emphasis on exploration, or will this thing be closer to a rail shooter--like 10? In the original, Midgar was pretty narrative-driven. You were guided from one plot point to the next (with some explorable dungeon-type areas, obviously). It wasn't until *after* Midgar that you were given a big world to play in. But if they made an entire game like the original Midgar... would that start to feel a bit... confining? Maybe not. Probably not.

What do you think? Is there more to come that will further shape this game, or is what we see what we're going to get?

906,"What new story do you think we will in the FF7REMAKE?Hello.

No not like changing or retconning stuff, the story will be the same with some elements from the compilation change for the remake.

Instead 100% brand new story material. Considering it's the legendary final fantasy 7 remake, It's almost impossible there won't be huge new story material.

They will still keep the original story, so I wouldn't worry about conflicting new information contradicting the original ff7 story.

Sorry for getting confusing, but to summarize what I meant, What brand new remake exclusive story elements do you predict square enix will add?

1: Possibly brand new story material that doesn't contradict clouds backstory with cloud.

2: Not exactly new but scrapped in the original ff7. Summon materia origins.

3: I think there's a huge possiblity we may get a flashback scene of the original meteor summoning (before the events ff7) in the materia temple. I wouldn't worry about this, ff7 has awesome optional scene's. This would be perfect as a optional scene.

Hopefully I didn't confuse you guy's, but what 100% brand new story material that we are able to predict are you looking forward to?

Hopefully it will let everyone appreciate every little detail now that it's all just audio and not visual.

So by actually fixing the story with Vincent, We can definitely find out the much bigger role he was supposed to have.

942,"Reasons i am now hyped for this game - Great game design decisions I can seeOriginally, I was expecting to be incredibly disappointed.  After watching the trailers and gameplay, my expected disappointment has turned to hype.

Heres why

Character Banter -

My expectation was for this non-existant and it was an unexpected surprise.   Getting the interactions between characters during boss fights is great.  The boss fights seem a bit long, but it's nice that we can get some added character development during the fights. It just adds a cool layer which makes it seem more like a movie and really helps meld the action gameplay with the RPG genre.

Nice Job!

Character Switching -

I was originally disappointed with the concept of swapping characters and only controlling a single person at a time.  What happens a lot in this types of games is that you find one person you are comfortable with, and play only with them, and not bother swapping.

This is speculation.  But it seems as if they are forcing player swaps based on characters strengths and enemy weaknesses.  This is clear in the demo when they talk about long-range vs melee.  It would be great if they added at least a few more ways to force us, the player, to swap characters.  

We also get Aeris's limit, which forces you to move players to the circle on the ground.  Interesting concept that falls inline with the idea of forcing the player to really utilize each characters specialties. 

The way magic weaknesses work also seems to indicate that magic oriented characters (like aeris) will be more valuable for specific fights.   

So - we have Cloud - melee high damage, Barret - Long range - shoot at things flying or on walls, Aeris, magic oriented - deal high damage, etc.

So with this, the devs have the ability to swap enemy weaknesses throughout a fight which encourages players to jump around to different characters throughout the fight to be truly efficient.

Nice Job!

Mini Games

I assumed mini-games would be toned down. But it seems as if they aren't forgetting any, and, of course, improving them.  What this tells me is that we might get fleshed out towns with actual Role Playing elements.  For years now, SE's MO has been to put players into a town, and have them run around aimlessly in a linear town with a singular, mostly linear purpose.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vREzGQsh038](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vREzGQsh038) (ff12 imperial city archades - a great example of how to build the worst town experience ever)

If we go back to the Wall Market - it was an amazing ROLE PLAYING experience because the town is lived in and we get to experience it as someone wandering around.  There were tons of people, all with something to say, which helped immerse you into the world. 

My worry with the remake was that the experience in Wall Market would be neutered.  But seeing the mini games makes be think they will be pulling much of what made that section of the game special into the remake.  I hope they add to it, and definitely hope they change a bit of the process of getting the dress around though.

Nice Job!",0

945,"I got to play the FF7R Demo... Here are my thoughts on itThe video link is my full 20min long ""what I thought"" and details regarding the demo experience:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQLcH5UikeE&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQLcH5UikeE&amp;t)

But for the purpose of the thread, here is The York Notes version...

* The gameplay is very much akin to that of a Yakuza game, there's many similarities in terms of being able to use attacks outside of enemy encounters to break open objects, environmental context attacks, the boss structure. If you've played any recent Yakuza games or to a very lessen extent Shenmue, you'll likely be familiar with the gameplay when exploring a dungeon.
* You can defeat enemies using environmental hazards, when I fought against the security in the reactor, it was possible to knock them off the platforms resulting in an instant kill. Assuming other dungeons/areas will have similar effects.
* There were 30 pods set up for the demo, I was in the 2nd group, I noticed the bulk on people in group 1 and my group all reached the boss at around the same time, after around 5min of gameplay... but for the majority of people, it took between 10-15 min and some took the full 20min in order to defeat the boss.
* Magic effects are really cool, like if you use the ice magic you can see ice crystals form on the target and it the enemies react as you'd expect them to depending on the magic effect.
* When you switch between characters, the Ai will use special moves and abilities on the character you leave control of, it won't default to standard attacks, it will also take cover. It will not use limit breaks and I didn't notice it using any magics.
* Chaining attacks is amazingly cool. Say you're controlling Cloud and you select an ability, you can then instantly switch to another character, select an ability or magic attack to perform. When you switch out of the menu and time begins to run at normal speed, both the characters will perform the attacks at around the same time which can result in some devastating attacks and effects.
* The only major negative I had was that it's very hard to keep track of HP an MP per character, whilst there is an onscreen display, it's so tucked away that it's one of those UI icons that you don't pay much attention to because your focus is drawn to the bulk of the action on screen.

If anyone has any additional questions as to what I thought, by all means ask on either the vid or here and I'll do my best to reply.

Examples being Gillian and Lucretia, who both were fine with Jenova cells \[Lucretia even became immortal from them\]. Shelke, on the other hand, who was treated with Mako got degeneration and other bad side effects that Gillian and Lucretia didn't.

I feel this Mako vulnerability may be why we don't see female Soldiers at all. However does anyone else know why?

As far as other FF7 Mako/Jenny experimented women we have Rosso, who was ""spliced with Genesis cells"" and not Mako \[afaik\] making her rather unique.

In the original Red XIII joins the party 90% the way through the Midgar section, surely this can't be the same for the remake. 

I think barring any significant story changes we can safely assume Red XIII joins the party at the same point in the Shinra building. As this is being sold as a full FF game, he must have his own Limits to learn and weapons to aquire, I can't see this all coming from the remainder the Shinra building and the escape. On top of this he is one of only 5 (that we know of) playable characters, and while I am by no means a developer must have been a challenge to create. If I was a dev I would want to show him off.

967,"What to expect for those intending to play the FF7R demo at EGX 2019 in LondonSo I just got back from the first day of EGX 2019 which just so happens to have FF7R demo kiosks. 

The FF7R section is a portion of the Playstation booth, its kinda small with only 30 kiosks for the demo to play on. Its in the first hall just after the ticket hall and queuing area so you'll need to be quick to get in line. The wait from the end of the line is supposedly 1 hour. It was a bit longer for me because they had technical issues and lost power to about half the kiosks. Fortunately they got them back up after about 20 minutes.

Next to the queue area is another small queue to get your picture taken while holding the Buster Sword. It's fairly weighty at 7KG! I was a bit disappointed that the Shinra propaganda video that Jessie hijacks was not present here for show. You go straight to a kiosk after queuing up. 

As for the demo itself, its still just the E3 demo we have seen before, no surprises there. However it is the English demo running with Japanese VO which I thought was an odd choice. In any case its very fun to play and looks great (despite definitely being an older build, the aliasing on Cloud's hair was super noticeable and seems to be much better in newer trailers). 

The Thursday crowd levels were pretty manageable, only the major AAA games had queues more than 30 minutes long, lots of smaller titles were either walk up and play or wait for the person in front of you to finish. I suspect this may change come the weekend though.

978,"So, at what event do you guys think we will get our next news/trailer?I’d like to hear all of your predictions. We’re only a few minutes months away from release so we should be getting more soon...",0
979,Braver. That is all.,0
980,"Something about the number 3Ok this might sound like some illumimati nonsense but hear me out..

So, we got SoP trailer, 3 weeks later was E3 with another new trailer. 3 months after that we got another new trailer at TGS.

Now let's just say we get something new in December because that's the midpoint between TGS and launch and they're not going to show nothing else for 6 whole months. That would be 3 months and more new stuff. Then 3 months after that is release date.

Oh and the cherry on top with the release date being 0303.

What does it all mean",0
981,Since their going for realismShould they show how monstrously strong cloud is for his size besides using big swords? Like a scene where he lifts a huge amount a debris on his own and people are just like whoa. Or maybe people barely wanting to talk to barret at all because of his gun arm? I think that would be realistic in a way. Or is it just too much?,0
982,"in regards of the compilationa lot of people seem to be under the impression that they have completely scrapped anything other then the base game of FF7, that is not the case, what was said was that the compilation won't get HD remasters right now because that would inflict with the contenity. not that things from the compilation wont get incorporated in to the remake..

i don't know how much of the compilation i would want in the remake..(except for Zack..i want Zack..) things did get a little crazy with DoC and CC :P but that's besides the point..

the canon for the remake is a new canon, they may or may not incorporate anything from the compilation in to this new canon. and Nomura even said ""Settings established in the FFVII Compilation works are newly incorporated and the story has been delved more deeply into""

i know there are posts like this often, but people still give you the ""its not canon anymore hurr durr"" any time you mention the compilation.. you need to get it straight!

here is a better post

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/atciw7/clearing\_things\_up\_compilation\_has\_not\_been/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/atciw7/clearing_things_up_compilation_has_not_been/)

&amp;#x200B;

now that we are here, lets take the time to share something from the compilation we would like to see in the remake:

personally i want more of Zack... just anything Zack.. a Zack DLC...more on his time with Aerith.. more on the nibelheim incident and how they escaped.. just more of that beautiful man in this game..and i think parts from AC could be nicely incorporated as well..",0
983,"(Speculation) How the game should be split.Ok I know there's already tons of posts like these, but I just finished replaying the original again, and now I have a great idea how the game could best be split up. Obviously this is my personal opinion, but I think I could be on to something,

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1: Midgar

So  the entirety of the game takes place in an expanded Midgar, or so we've been told. However, I wouldn't be surprised if they snuck Kalm in the end, and the Sephiroth flashback. (Can you imagine being able to play with Seph in the party with you during this part?) I think it's likely this is in the first game, because we've seen Sephiroth show up in the trailers, and they would need to explain the deal with him and Cloud's backstory to first time players, who they are also marketing towards. It would be weird playing a whole game with no real knowledge of who the main character is. Also, just as they did in the original, this would be an awesome sneak peak at end-game level content and powers, to tease what's to come in the later installments.

Part 2: Open world (Kalm- to Whirlwind Maze)

This is what excites me. If the first game will take place in one city, then the next game has the opportunity to feel completely fresh by being treated as an open-world adventure game. This hypes me up thinking how they could use this approach and give us plenty more to explore throughout the first areas of Disc 1. But i don't think they should end it right after the Aerith scene. That's too short of content for an entire game, imo. I think they should just go a little further and have the second game go until they reach the Whirlwind maze, where Seph/the Weapons awaken, and they lose Cloud.

Part 3: Final Acts (Mideel to Norther Crater)

Imagine starting the third game without Cloud! That would be really interesting and give you an opportunity to get more experience with the rest of the cast. Also this would feel like a great starting point because, Meteor will be summoned, and the Weapons will be present, making the game feel like something new. The journey to get Cloud back could be a really awesome chapter that will make players  feel like they need to earn his return, especially after maining him for 2 games and losing him, I can see getting him back feeling very rewarding! Everything from here on will take us to the end of the game, which isn't all too much story-wise, but will give space for all the great endgame content like battle arena, and secret bosses.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this approach?",0

989,"Genesis..?so i just finished Crisis Core for the first time, and boy o boy did they introduce a shit ton of convoluted-ness to the already confusing story of FF7!  i know the remake is a new canon but i wonder about Genesis, i have a feeling he is one of Nomura's babies and Nomura like to include his babies in his games.

Genesis was also in the secret ending to Dirge of Cerberus, which makes me think they have thought of more story for him then we have seen in the compilation. or was the ending to DoC just supposed to set up CC?

the compilation always feel like loose canon to me, so its gonna be interesting to see how much they include in the remake because they sure have lots to pick from.

&amp;#x200B;

edit/ i was wrong! genesis is not a nomura boy! i take that back! and also initially he was only supposed to appear in the secret ending to DoC and they made up his backstory after! so i also take that back!",0

* **What is Final Fantasy XV?**

Final Fantasy XV (Japanese: ファイナルファンタジーXV; Simplified Chinese: 最终幻想15; Traditional Chinese: 最終幻想XV; stylized FINAL FANTASY XV; Final Fantasy 15 in some regions; abbreviated FFXV and FF15), the fifteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, follows Prince Noctis of Lucis and his three friends who must save the world of Eos by defeating the Niflheim Empire and purging darkness the plagues the ""star"" (another name for world).

Due to the scale of the game's narrative, the Final Fantasy XV project was split into several multi-media parts, dubbed the Final Fantasy XV Universe, to increase awareness of the game to different audiences.

* **Should I play Final Fantasy XV?**

The answer to this question is ultimately up to you. What some consider “good” might be others’ “bad,” and vice versa.

The game’s strengths lie in:

* the layered characterization.
* the themes of friendship, brotherhood, and accepting your duty with grace.
* the attention to “little things.”
* the freedom of choice in combat and exploration.
* the graphics.

However, some criticism includes:

* the implicit storytelling and unexplained events.
* the amount of research required to completely understand the story.
* the simplistic depictions of war, politics, and revenge.
* the linear final third of the game.
* the lack of forced difficulty.

We strongly recommend you form your own opinion!

* **What are all the pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The confirmed pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe are the works in the following table.

Feature-length Games|Mobile-only Games|Demos|Downloadable Content|Featured Audiovisual|Trailers

Pieces that are not confirmed to be part of the Final Fantasy XV Universe include Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn -Prologue-; Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn; and Final Fantasy XV: The Dawn of the Future.

* **Do I need to play the DLCs, experience all of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, or play other Final Fantasy games?**

The DLCs and the Final Fantasy XV Universe is entirely optional. According to Tabata, their purpose is for a player to “get a better view of the world where the game is set.”  While each part of the Final Fantasy XV Universe is optional, “some fans who only see one part might be left with a negative impression, or like they've missed crucial parts of the tale.” You can play Final Fantasy XV without playing the DLCs or experiencing the Final Fantasy XV Universe, but you will need to pay more attention to context clues.

You do not need to play other Final Fantasy games in order to understand Final Fantasy XV. Each “numbered” Final Fantasy does not share a storyline with another. At most, playing other Final Fantasy games allow you to notice references and recurring themes.

* **What is the best order to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The crucial pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, besides the main game itself, and other pieces are listed below. They are listed in the order in which they were released and include the approximate time they take place in the “timeline” (see “Which parts are ‘canon’?”). Use this information to determine when is the best time to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe and related media.

1. Platinum Demo — 12 year before the beginning of the game.
2. Brotherhood — 15, 12, 8, and 5 years before the start of the game, and Chapters 1 through 3.
3. Kingsglaive — less than a year before the start of the game to the start of the game.
4. Prologue ~Parting Ways~ — the day before the start of the game.
5. Episode Gladiolus — during Chapter 7.
6. Episode Prompto — during Chapters 12 and 13.
7. Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades — between Chapters 13 and 14 and, for Future quests, Chapter 14.
8. Episode Ignis — during Chapters 9, 13, 14, and the end of the game.
9. Royal Pack — adds content throughout the entire game.
10. Episode Ardyn -Prologue- — &gt;!2,000!&lt; years before the beginning of the game and Chapter 14.
11. Episode Ardyn — &gt;!2,000!&lt;, &gt;!35!&lt;, and &gt;!22!&lt; years before and Chapter 14.

Final Fantasy XV was developed by Square Enix Business Division 2 (later renamed Luminous Productions) and published by Square Enix.

* **What are the upcoming DLC and updates for Final Fantasy XV?**

Development for Final Fantasy XV ended on March 25, 2019, with the release of Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn. The other three planned Dawn of the Future DLC—Episode Aranea, Episode Lunafreya, and Episode Noctis—have been canceled. However, a novelization of the Dawn of the Future DLC was released in Japan on April 25, 2019, and an English version will be coming *no earlier* than Fall 2019.

There are no updates planned for the main game or Final Fantasy XV Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades because development has been ceased. However, there may still be small updates to the executable files. (This is not the same as a bug fix.)

* **What's up with the different versions of Comrades? Can I still get the Comrades DLC version trophies?**

Initially, Comrades was released as a DLC expansion launched through Final Fantasy XV called Multiplayer Expansion: Comrades. As of patch 1.27, the DLC expansion was moved to a standalone launcher on consoles called Multiplayer: Comrades. The PC version is the only platform that does not have a standalone launcher for Comrades.

After patch 1.27 on consoles, the DLC expansion's trophies are no longer obtainable. Furthermore, any trophies earned and any saves created on the DLC expansion will be transferred to the standalone version, although trophies may not activate until you unlock certain parts of the game. Finally, players can still access the DLC version to view previous photos and create characters for the &gt;!Chapter 14 cameo!&lt;; you cannot play missions on the DLC version.

* **Which version of Final Fantasy XV should I buy?**

Final Fantasy XV was released in many different editions. Please use [this table in our Wiki to view the differences between each edition’s content](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/console#wiki_difference_between_editions).

As a rule of thumb:

* If you do not have a copy of Final Fantasy XV, you should buy the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition for the PS4 or XB1 and the Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition for PC. These editions are a bundle of all of the 2016 to 2018 content; the 2019 content (Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn) has not been released as a cost-effective bundle.
* If you do have a copy of Final Fantasy XV for PS4 or XB1, wish to keep playing on PS4 or XB1, do not want the “bonus items”, and the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition is not on sale, it’s more cost-effective to buy the DLC individually.
* If you are considering whether to buy the Windows Edition, keep in mind that it is meant for high-end computers. Use the demo and benchmark tool to determine whether your system will run Final Fantasy XV to your satisfaction. Beware of late-game spoilers in the trailer at the end of the demo!
* Consider buying the game on sale. The base game and its bundles are often on sale for around 50% off.
* If you are buying a *used copy* Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition, make sure it comes with working codes. The DLC is not included on the disc.
* On console, the DLC region needs to match the base game region.

* **My game’s not working! How do I fix it?**

Please attempt some troubleshooting yourself by following [our Technical Support guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/tech_support) for consoles and PC before making a help post. If you're making a help post, be as specific as possible with your problem and attempts to fix it.

I decided to go for this trophy first, so i hunted down some guides and went looking for my missing entries for Almanic and Omega files, the only problem is, i go to the actual locations, and nothing is there, nothing to interact with at all.

9,"Question regarding daily quest Comrades 2.1.0Hello,

I am currently trying to obtain my last trophy ""Kenny come back"" on the steam version of the game. I've been playing comrades for longuer than I care to admit and it still never spawned. I was wondering if anyone know if we are still able to do daily quest online with other players in this version. I saw online that there is a way to nearly garantee Kenny's spawn if done this way.

If so, I'd like to know if anyone wants to join with me?

Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Never I finaly got him to spawn after about 9 hours and 30 minutes to spawn while doing the hunt Level 5 Quadrupedal Plateau. All AIs had level 1 meat and I had no food. The owner just came and served me :D hehe. Finally!",1

15,"""APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS"" Lyrics and Meaning~Salvete omnes!

I have, via contact with some Final Fantasy Distant Worlds folk, obtained the choral score to ""APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS"", and importantly, the lyrics. While they are in Latin, are really interesting, and written one who has studied ancient Roman culture and language. There is A LOT of specific religious imagery and allusions. At this time, I cannot provide a smooth translation (I should actually be studying for the Latin exam I have coming up...), but I will soon! And in the meantime, I'll post the lyrics, and my thoughts on what I gathered from site reading them.

&amp;#x200B;

**-During the Intro-**

Specie tua, tantum carnem adme omnes habet cultum

Ego sum qui mittit petras et gubernat omnes vitae.

Coelum\*, Terra, aversione. Magna, parvus, reversusque.

Fortis ductor, praecipio Quod ligabis lucem vobis.

**-Verse, after string melody-**

Cum omnibus lucis plenus, Apocalypse finibus

Victum unus qui comedit, Hic vitae omnia; tenebris

**-During oboe solo, choir is quiet-**

Malum incarnatus surgit, Adducentes secum mortem.

Para! Para! PARA! PARA!

**-After the Key Change, the women and men sing this next part in stretto (offset from each other)-**

Fortis Rex, Bellator, in manus gladio Bellum in virtute,

Victum quod hostibus. Para!

**-After the strings' and piano descending scale in octaves | More stretto between the women and men-**

Magis mortem venit primum. Quod est quidam venire.

Para omnes! Para omnes! Para omnes! *(the women sing ""Para omnes"" on offbeats while the men sing ""Para"" thrice across the whole stanza)*

**-Final stanza, the Big Finale-**

Nunc est tempus, Haec est locus Ubi nos obstandum, omne tandem ex nobis.

Unum! Omnes!

***-BIG G IN THE LOW BRASS AND STRINGS-***

\*Coelum is an alternate spelling of Caelum, which means sky/heaven. In Medieval Latin (which again, this is), that's the common spelling. It also helps to avoid confusing it with the Caelum family. In this case, coelum is  indeed just heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, we are being told the King, the True King, is the highest of them all. Both Heaven and Earth avert (Coelum, Terra, aversione) their gazes from him. He shines plenty of light, he's got a sword, he's really powerful, nothing compares. His arrival is the end. The Astrals (my interpretation) are telling you to prepare yourself (Para!) for the coming of True King. And once you've done that, go tell everyone else to prepare (Para omnes!). I'm not saying that the True King is God, since the writers stopped short of calling him that in the lyrics, but there is certainly a fair of... comparison to be made with a certain other ""King of Kings"".

Anyways, I'll update this post with a translation as soon as I can! If anyone else wants to tackle it, please by all means! Hope y'all can find some fun things in this!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I can't believe I didn't even translate the title. While it's probably obvious, I'll do it anyways. Says ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" or ""Noctis's Apocalypse"". I personally would go with the first one, since while Latin doesn't distinguish between something like ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" and ""Noctis's Apocalypse"" in the genitive case like we would in English, the first one I find fits better aesthetically. But either would be an acceptable translation.",1

However, I was amused how his combat reminded me more of games like dmc or onimusha. The health bar not refilling and more emphasis on survival. I just enjoy being able to prepare...

However, I just got to prompto and... am I only one who thinks this is a fun change of pace?

Like, I actually enjoyed Dirge of Cerberus. I wont deny its faults. But it was still fun. This feels like a more involved version of that.

I love the different weapons, strategies, and how he just plays. I wouldnt actually mind a whole game like this.

Plus he naturally regains health and so it's more like a third person shooter rpg. I would love to see a game where you get to steal weapons, add them to your arsenal. Gotta collect ammo, but keep it sort of scarce. Or instead of stealing the weapon a second time, if they hold the same weapon you have equipped you simply get ammo for it. The  something like resonance of fate where you can customize the guns. Rpg like. 

I feel square is sitting on something that could truly be amazing. Prompto is also the only character of the four who had a background. A past full of darkness and mystery (they failed to really explore...). And I just love the goofball. So maybe seeing him after the events of the main game having to deal with a new threat would be awesome.

Anyone else feel like i do?",1

50,"Questions about Versus XIII (Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC spoilers!)I didn't know whether to post here or to the KH subreddit, but I figured that this place would have more people that are aware of the development process of Versus XIII which later on turned out to be FFXV. I've been googling a lot of things and since I'm not familiar as to what happened in the long development process, I was hoping that someone could give me some answers or just correct me if (when) I get some things wrong. I'll try and make a TLDR at the bottom. 

So to summarize, the KH3 Re:Mind DLC (spoilers) had a (actually two) secret ending which basically recreated a VXIII trailers opening frames. It has Yozora (character strongly resembling Noctis) waking up in a car. There are lots of comparison videos online, if you want to check it out. But basically that and earlier references to VsXIII and FFXV have been interpreted by lots of people as a sign that Nomura is 'salty' about losing Versus XIII and that he will make it (versus) no matter what. Now I'm here not to discuss as to whether or not Nomura will try to recreate the project, but I'm here to ask why Nomura would be salty. 

I'll now write something based on things I've read and how I've experienced them. Correct me if I'm wrong during any of this. VsXIII was revealed in 2006 with a cinematic trailer and as the years progressed more and more trailers came, but no actual release dates/signs of the game being close to release. I've understood that there's been also development hell surrounding the project, with lots of troubles regarding game engines (?) etc. The game was later renamed (don't know what's the correct word here) to FFXV in 2013, and Nomura was removed (?) in 2014. Then Square said that 

&gt;This move allows Tetsuya Nomura to focus his full efforts as the director of other highly anticipated titles, including Kingdom Hearts III

So Nomura had been working on a title for 8 years, and according to Tabata the game had been 20-25% complete before it became FFXV. So clearly not nearly ready and Nomura had to move on to other projects, like KH3 which was already highly anticipated at the time. This is where my question as to why Nomura is or even would be salty? He had a lot of time to develop the game and although a lot of the roadblocks weren't created/caused by him, he had to have understood that it was time to move on. Also I feel like FFXV pretty much did justice to Versus XIII and things that Nomura had created. This is just based off of my personal gameplay experience of FFXV and watching Versus trailers but the two seem to have had a lot of similiar ideas and themes. Surely some differences (Stella vs Lunafreya, Fabula Nova Crystalis) but that would be inevitable when you consider a creative process that span upon over 10 years. But even in the very first trailer of versus there are things that carried over to FFXV. From my point of view it seems like XV respected the ideas/groundwork that Nomura had laid out for Versus. For gods sake Nomura's name is the only one that you see on the title screen. So do you think that Nomura feels like he's been unjustifiably removed from Versus XIII and that square took away his dream project?

As for another note now that I've gotten excited about the future of KH, I've stumbled into a lot lot of comment sections praising Versus and bashing XV. That just seems like the biggest circlejerk I've probably ever seen. Like how can you love a game that you never got to play, that you've mostly just seen pre-rendered gameplay and trailers. It wasn't even a complete game and nobody knew what the story would be, but I've seen people saying things like 'Stella was the perfect antagonist' and 'it was everything I liked in a video game'. Like how can someone say such things and be serious? To me it seems like VsXIII is something that a lot of people have created their own unique versions in their head, and now have collectively decided that it was an amazing game. When it really wasn't even a complete game.

But yeah I'd appreciate it if anybody wants to share their thoughts about these things with me and answer some of the things I've yet to understand. Also feel free to correct me if I stated something obviously wrong, I'm a little hazy about the facts since I'm completely new to FF as a whole. Hope that this was managable to read, since English isn't my first language. 


TLDR: With certain parts of KH3 having many similarities with Versus XIII/FFXV people now say that Nomura is salty about 'losing' Versus XIII. Is this the case, and has Nomura got any reason to be salty?",1

56,"about Yozora, i'm starting to think..that maybe Versus 13 was initially intended to be Versus Kingdom Hearts... people seem to think Nomura created Yozora and that whole thing out of pettiness for having lost FFXV and Noctis, but i think this was his plan all along..but for Noctis

the first versus trailer came out in 2006, just one year after KH2! and if i remember correctly back around that time it was being compared alot to KH, and looking back at that trailer now it does feel more like KH than FF..but with blood :P

so my theory is that Nomura wanted to use that unnamed protagonist (that later became Noctis) in his own series that would run parallel to KH and then eventually cross over in KH3.. like KH but without disney and really dark..heck, maybe OG Noctis kingdom was in the realm of darkness!

but square was going in hard with the FNC so it ended up there as versus 13, and then later became FFXV..and when he basically lost custody of Noct he couldn't/ didn't want to go through with his original idea..delaying KH3..

but now he's doing it with new characters.. im curious to see where he's going with this.. i love FFXV, its probably my favorite game of all times, but i wouldn't mind seeing Nomura's original vision come to life in the KH univers.. but then again, Yozora is cool and all but he ain't no Noct..

the more i think about this the more clues and similarities i see

a while back i made a [theory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/comments/ds2ncr/a_theory_on_what_happend_with_xvs_story_cuts/) about how i think the moon was gonna play a part in the FFXV story but was cut late in production leading to the story feeling wonky in some parts.. i was gonna make a follow up with a theory about how the moon would have played in but i never got around to it

i think the moon would have played much the same roll as Etro's gate would have in the original concept, collecting the souls of the dead, ~~it would probably also have been closely connected to Luna lol.~~ if that was the case it would make sense for Ardyn to spread the starscourge to turn people in to daemons so that our protagonists would kill them and fuel the moon, until something.

now, replace the moon with kingdom hearts, Ardyn with Xehanort, and the daemons with heartless and you basically have a twist on the KH basic concept!

at first i was like ""this is too much like KH, it can't be right, Nomura wouldn't create 2 stories that similar""but now with the Yozora stuff im starting to think there might be something to this and that he created the Versus world to be a dark parallel to KH, with a similar but darker story and without disney.

basically sora= realm of light, OG Noctis= realm of darkness, and they are connected by the realm of dreams!  back in the day Noctis whole deal was that he slept alot :P and Sora sure does alot of dreaming! nomura has said that Noct and Sora are complete opposites in many ways, but there are alot connecting the 2 of them!

nothing is either good or bad, only thinking makes it so

(edit: KH1 secret ending for those who think im completely crazy comparing versus and KH  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtXZp3B-tc&amp;ab\_channel=RajmanGamingHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtXZp3B-tc&amp;ab_channel=RajmanGamingHD) (yes i know its roxas and riku)",1

I don't think the legacy of FFXV/Versus X-III is over quite yet, seems like Nomura has more to say on it. I did a more thorough write up on how Noctis may tie into the Kingdom Hearts series. https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/etk0x0/discussion_2_quick_theories_after_remind_spoilers/ The first theory shows how a Kingdom Hearts character appears in the Re:Mind trailer, while the second tries to tackle how we see Yozora/Noctis utilized, and how we may see him utilized in the future.",1
62,"Replaying the game for the 1st time in 2 years has reminded me how much I love this game.I was late to the part when it comes too FF.  I got into the series when FF7 came out on PS4. Shortly I have I played 8 &amp; 10. So, when 15 came out I was exited and I loved every second of it. The beauty of its world, the relationship between the character and the action. The gameplay has never felt repetitive or tired. I think I am having more fun now than I did at first. Apparently I have spent 220 hrs playing the game thanks too new game plus.

63,"The worst part of the game: flyingI honestly cant believe I am unable to find much info about flying.

Especially how terrible it is.

Honestly, who thought making flying a frustrating experience in a final fantasy game was a good idea? Hell, the mere more thought that crossed a devs mind in which it was possible to DIE while flying should have been grounds for being fired.

One little touch? Hit the ground slightly too hard? Instant death? 

Oh, and spending five minutes each time you die to try again.

This should be a huge topic yet I can find almost nothing on it.

Flying is supposed to be the best part in final fantasy games. Go where you want. Uncover new areas. The world is your oyster. Yet this is the most god awful exp I have ever had in an ff game. Far worst than chocobo racing in ff10. 

There is literally zero fun or incentive to fly. I should just hover and hit x to land. Instead I am trying to control an unwieldy hunk of junk that explodes upon being glanced at.

Anyone else share these sentiments?",1

65,"The Best Story BossI like the later chapters of the game in spite of some serious criticism but to me the last and greatest story boss in FFXV was Leviathan.

[https://youtu.be/g\_CmnODCQA0](https://youtu.be/g_CmnODCQA0)

[https://youtu.be/w7y3XNIdGVQ](https://youtu.be/w7y3XNIdGVQ)

The fight receives so much hype and build. There's a lot of tension and drama and intrigue with the Empire and Luna and Ardyn and Ravus and of course our heroes all being there.  Leviathan proves to be quite...willful and it's up to Noct to prove himself to this goddess.

The music is some of the best in the game - which is saying something.

The visuals are amazing for both phases.

Noct is overcome with a mix of anguish and fury and desperation and we can feel that, too.

I don't think any of these factors were in such perfect alignment in any other fight. It's equal parts emotional and awesome and just plain fun.

Daemon Ravus had potential but there's so much happening at that point that our heroes are kind of on emotional overload (as are we) so we can't really spare him as much feeling as we did our heroes in the Leviathan fight.",1

78,"The Theme of FFXV is ""Obeying Fate""So, as a long time JRPG fan, I've of course heard the cliche about ""of course God is evil"" or ""of course the church is evil."" FFX had an evil church and FFXIII had evil gods. I chose my thread title to specifically contrast with the song ""Fighting Fate"" in FFXIII which was used as the boss theme for our enslaved heroes defying the god who was trying to use them. Because FFXV ultimately has the total opposite message of FFXIII.

Behind all the Bromance, Final Fantasy XV is a game about duty and responsibility and, yes, fate. The fal'Cie - the gods of FFXIII - are actively malicious beings who care nothing for humans and even take some pleasure in their suffering. From the start humans were just pans to the fal'Cie. The death of all humans is the goal of the fal'Cie in the game. While the citizens of Cocoon venerate the fal'Cie it's made very clear this is just a cultivated image, a lie, and that they are in no way benevolent.

Then we come to Final Fantasy XV. It gives you the Cosmogony at the start and never wavers from that tone.The great and decidedly (morally) Good Six created humanity and the world. Everyone from every place clearly worships the gods and never once is this worship questioned, quite the opposite in fact.  In his benevolence, Bahamut blessed the Oracle so as to help humans. Continuing on in the game we see remnants of the mightiest, most advanced civilization on Eos and Shiva tells us this was a group of humans who actively worshiped and worked with Ifrit.  Only when they became ungrateful and arrogant did they lose everything. Speaking of Shiva, the Empire killing her reeks havoc on the planet. Far from just being morally good, the Six appear to wield a metaphysical influence over the world such that killing any of them is slitting your own throat by destroying the world.

And then of course there's the ending. Noctis does not just give his life for the people or to restore the light. He does it because it is his destiny, because it has been ordained by the gods. This beautiful, heroic moment is beautiful and heroic because it shows Noctis' faith in the divine and their plan. He gave himself to fate to save the world.

Ultimately, FFXV states again and again and again that the gods are good, destiny is good, and you have to bow to both if you want good to happen.",1

It happened to me several times.

Apparently the reason Noct is on the ground for so long is to give you a chance to use a Phoenix Down. I never realized this and if the tutorial told me, I forgot it.

So that's on me.

But here's my problem with FFXV's gameplay. Potions never worked for me. I swear to God I tried using them a lot in early game and they never worked. I'd open the menu to heal somebody and their names would be grayed out. Elixirs always worked. I spammed Elixirs and Hi Elixirs a ton later on. But Potions? I just thought they didn't work.

91,"A thank you to Final Fantasy XVI'm really not one to pour my heart out online but I thought I'd post this. Hopefully no one makes fun of me, haha.  

A year ago today I was introduced to the Final Fantasy series, for the first time, by my brother. At the time I was going through some heavy depression after several stressful events in my life. I was pretty much at my lowest point and needed something to do while I was recovering from a small injury (nothing major) and a really bad common cold. 

So my brother downloaded some games on Steam for me and we started Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition. Again, I had never played a Final Fantasy game nor any RPGs, either. I had zero expectations. I didn't know about Versus XIII or the controversy surrounding the game. I was just excited for something new to focus on.  

I could could go on about how much fun I had while playing the game but I'll keep it short and sweet. I  *loved* the music, which is what stood out to me first. Valse Di Fantastica/Sunset Waltz, Noctis and Stand By Me are songs that I still hum constantly. I really appreciated the focus on friendship/brotherhood and loved the four main characters. I grew so attached to them actually that when I was accidentally spoiled about &gt;!Noctis' fate I forced myself to believe it wouldn't happen and when it finally did, I was heartbroken but satisfied with the ending. !&lt; Noctis and Prompto are both characters who I could really relate with and the relationship between the four reminded me of what friends I do have, as well as my brother. Not only that, but the theme of living on even after the death of a loved one is something that resonated with me deeply. 

It didn't take me very long to beat the game, about three weeks of playing every day and after school, but in that time I started to feel happier and still, I find it silly that a video game is what helped me through such a slump.

Today I see a lot of people say video games are bad for you, and I think this stigma is slowly fading but as an addition FFXV didn't keep me inside, it inspired me to do the things I thought were the most fun in-game, besides, riding giant birds. 

I kept pursuing my passion for photography, I decided for the first time, ""Why not go camping?"" and ended up going and loving it. I started hiking and going fishing with my dad which he was surprised by. I got into Florence + The Machine and after a year of an art block, I started drawing again. 

Now, video games are just another hobby of mine like the ones above. Final Fantasy XV introduced me into the series as a whole, I ended up playing FFX last summer and I'm very excited for the FFVII remake. I also ended up playing some other RPGs, because of the amazing in-game voice actors, which I never would have thought of doing before. 

I was going through a lot of hardship last year but in short Final Fantasy is just one thing that helped me move on. 

**TLDR:** Final Fantasy XV got me through a really bad depression and I thought I'd share why I love this game. I hope for anyone whose shared my experiences, video games have helped you too.",1

99,"[SPOILERS] Thoughts after completionTen years and then four more years later... and I finally got around to playing this game.

I was originally far more excited for it than FF13 when it was announced. Waited forever. Then got worried with the reviews. To me, the Final Fantasy series is a staple in story telling. I have been let down before, but this game truly took the cake.

FF13 was too convoluted. Though I did enjoy it's two sequels. It was just a headache to follow. But I give them props for the amount of effort they DID pour into the story.FF12 was one that I just felt was empty. It had everything there, but I just couldn't find myself drawn to any of the characters or world.

&amp;#x200B;

But then comes FF15. A game with SO much potential that I feel especially empty upon reaching the ending. A road trip among four friends... how can we POSSIBLY screw up that kind of emotional payload?! The first 90% of the game does exactly that.

&amp;#x200B;

First, if I don't want to feel like a COMPLETE third (or well, fifth?) wheel; I need to watch Brotherhood. Why? Why didn't they redo these episodes in the ACTUAL game? How great it would have been to get little snippits like this. In fact, every camp spot should have had at least maybe ONE scene. SOMETHING like a flashback or a shared moment. Nothing HUGE, just... something more. They forget that we did not create these characters. We did not spend time growing up with them. We are the stranger entering a new group of friends we just made who are all like, 'remember that one time Noctis fell asleep?"" ""OH YEAH! That was SOOOO funny!"" and I am like, 'context please?'

&amp;#x200B;

We have a group of four friends. I want to know ALL about them. Everything up to this point in time. What has kept them together. What instills faith in one another? The road trip itself should have been wrought with peril and challenges. There were a few side quests that brought them together, but I felt each area should have had it's own unique NPC. At least one. That gave some sort of quest that either challenged their friendship, or highlighted it. Instead of like 5 NPC's that after you do a quest, they move to another location. More reason to explore. More reason to do side quests. Even something as simple as a little conversation as you are running to the destination of how this side quest reminds you guys of a time or connects to a part of your past.

See where I am going with this? They had so many opportunities to bring these guys together and make you FEEL for them. To UNDERSTAND them. To LOVE them. Instead, up to the end, I feel like I don't belong in this group of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads to the other problem with the narrative. The first 75% of the games story can basically be summarized with, 'Lets go get married! Oh no, my kingdom is dead! Lets find my weapons! Lets go speak to the summon dudes! Lets get back on track to getting over the sea! Oh no, Luna is dead! Oh no, we are all depressed! Oh no, Ignis is blind! Oh no, Prompto is gone!' before anything really GOOD gets going.

&amp;#x200B;

We should have started in Insomnia. Get a real idea of Noctis' life. Meet up with each friend. Get to understand a little bit of the role they play. Learn a bunch of lore about the city, about these characters, about who YOU are. Then, get summoned to go on a road trip. By this point, Luna should have really been highlighted. More scenes with her. More flashbacks. Maybe see what she is CURRENTLY doing? I would have liked to have actually CARED about her. The whole 'we havent seen each other in forever' thing creates a divide between us that doesn't quite work. If she was to remain alive through the game and maybe die at the end, then them not having seen each other for forever might have meant something. But to give her a few scenes, have them SEE each other, and then kill her? How am I supposed to FEEL for her? And damn it, coming from a long time never recovering from Aerith's death, can I tell you how badly I WANT to feel for the love interest! That is MY shit right there! What really gets me weepy! So to deny me of this in a FINAL FANTASY game is like... tragic.

&amp;#x200B;

So after you leave the kingdom, you got the basic story of trying to get to your destination. Car breaks down. Learn a bit about the open world and quests. And it continues as it it did. Now, we get the FULL story of what happens while away. Or at least, we EVENTUALLY do.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is... they want me to watch ANOTHER story elsewhere to understand this part?! You could have totally shown me so much about the King, what he had done, why he is important, why the crystal is important, his abilities, and those who sat next to him during the prologue I spoke of earlier. So even if I can't be allowed to see all that happens in Kingsglaive, I should have gotten pieces of it throughout the story. Beginning here. So that I ALSO care about how much this affects Noctis. Again, I need to feel for these characters. So why not help me do that? Either now, or by the end. I dont mind them changing my opinion of someone through the course of the game. LIke I keep getting to see things that make me go, 'man, this king was so nice! I like him so much! Now I feel I wish I knew more before he died!'. Nope. None of that is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Now after all that, you get a couple of main goals. But they are so half hazardly put together and all the inbetween stuff only makes this worst. I need to find Luna, get my weapons, and get my astrals. Okay. Good. But the problem is, each start of a mission is a whole chapter. Like, you accomplish ONE thing and the chapter ends? And the world being open for a few chapters without the use of Umbra also kind of breaks the pacing between these events. It consistently feels like a whole lot of nothing is happening between these events. Now, you can maybe remedy that a LITTLE by going straight to the main story and skipping side quests until the end. However, you give people an open world and they are going to explore.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts on this? They should have opened the world slowly. Through each chapter. And by doing this, they could have put more emphasis on the side quests and visiting each location. You have your main objective for the chapter, but you also have all these camps to draw memories from. All these side quests that bring the boys together. Instead, we get a series of glorified fetch quests that really don't offer anything or really open up the world. Again, some do. But I mean, when you arent making he feel things for the boys, you can at least enrich the world. Quests that basically delve into the past and help me understand all the events that lead to this point in time. Different things the Empire did, ect. Rather than giving me random data logs or news bulletins, or dropping it all on me at the end of the game... enrich the world itself through side quests.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to recap some of that... I basically constantly felt like a third wheel. I learned nothing of my main heroes. The main story points felt like they were cliff notes. So much wasted potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes chapter 13. I realized Niflheim is empty. People are all gone. Big twist and turns are awaiting me!  Oh, I am given a choice to play Gladio. I should do that first right? ... oh, I skip pretty much all of Noctis' story instead of picking up where Noctic begins... who decided this was a great idea? But hey, they added this LATER apparently because originally they werent going to tell you SHIT about Revus. So lets dive into that.

&amp;#x200B;

They make a big thing with a scene about who will obviously be our big enemy players. I am expecting many up coming battles with them. I get... one? And then immediately we end up on the same side later. Awesome. And Revus, okay, this guy is strong! Bad ass! We gonna fight bro!..... or not. Or we can have this one convo. I see you and Luna have a convo. And then I am just supposed to find you dead?! WHY DID YOU RUIN THIS CHARACTER?! He could have been a rival I struggle to beat for a while!!

&amp;#x200B;

And the rest of the bad guys. The Emperor makes no sense. The scientist guy I cant even recall his face. And the other general I captured for two seconds just vanishes? WHY DO I FEEL SO LOST?! And what of the Diamond Weapons in the beginning?! Why have I still not fought you?!

&amp;#x200B;

And then a stream of info is just DUMPED on me. I cant even hear Ardyn's great monologue about why he is doing what he is doing because for some reason they decided that Noctis' grunts should be in the foreground instead of quiet in the background. Prompto is a clone or something?! Why is this not hinted like AT all. Brought up through multiple scenes. Especially encounters with the bad guys or talks about the Empire making him look odd. Or a reservation to fight the MT's. Like, so many ways you could have done it. Instead he vanishes for a bit and I guess I gotta play his DLC to actually not feel lost? That should have been part of the game ITSELF. In fact, every time a character vanishes it should have been part of the game where I jump over to them. And of course, the main characters downplay it like, 'no one cares where you are from, you are our buddy!' which would have felt AWESOME if this was more prevalent in the actual course of the story!

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, I reach the ending. Noctis wants a picture. At this point, you finally get it. The entire story, the entire game, it was about the journey itself. About the memories shared between these four friends. All that they experienced together. It was supposed to be about their roadtrip/struggle up to this very point. Or it should have been. Again, I suggested earlier that having a series of camp flash backs, side stories (the ones they DID do barely offered anything new); or side quests with a unique NPC for each outlook area. Because if they did this, I would have had all kinds of MEMORIES too! Instead, I have no memories. I can barely remember what some of the pictures were from. Most were from main story points that felt like cliff notes.

&amp;#x200B;

And the shame? The shame is that this is the most brilliant idea I have seen in a long arse time. I mean, I would have had SO many emotions. I am a very emotional guy. I LOVE THIS KIND OF SHIT. Like, when that happened, I felt a bit empty. Especially the realization that this was the end of the road. They were about to lose their friend, that tied them all together. Things will NEVER be the same for them. The journey with your friends. Like those friends you made in school. That you made memories with. Spent years of your life with. How you grow up and you never see each other again. THAT KIND OF EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE. Realizing I am growing older, nothing is forever, this stuff is heavy and it is as depressing as FF13's Lightning Return (which, dont get me started on why they are going all emo on me these days in FF, haha).

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much wasted potential in this game that it makes me cry. I mean, I spent all night feeling empty as well. And for the WRONG reasons. I wanted to feel empty because I beat the game. Because the realization of these revelations. Because of the memories I made on my journey and having to say goodbye to a friend. Instead, I felt empty because of how much more this story could have made me feel. All the lost potential.

&amp;#x200B;

I wont really talk about combat because there are a lot of areas I would improve. However, I will say it is one of my favorite battle systems and am sad this game didnt do better because I would LOVE to see more of it. I loved the multiple weapons. The conjuring of the weapons. The Armiger. Like, yes, more please.

&amp;#x200B;

But really, this is about the story. My god they had the makings of a master piece. It could have been my most favorite FF to date. My favorite story. I see all the areas they could have improved. I read leaks that might not be true, but those leaks had a more coherent and well organized story than this. Just reading the 'cliff' notes felt more detailed and put together than what we got. There are parts of those leaks I would have preferred. But even with what we got, I imagine what we COULD have done with it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is in no way bashing the game. Just... man... at Chapter 13 things escalated fast and there was so much more emotion I could have felt that was missed. The surprises could have been better. The deaths better. And of course the whole, 'its been 10 years, go past start, don't collect 100 dollars, fight the last boss now' felt so rushed. I wanted time to explore this new world. Did we HAVE to sleep for 10 years? Or at least spend more time trying to fix things before realizing we have to take the fight to Insomnia? I could go on all day. But I will leave it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

If they ever released a PS5 version that completely redid the first 12 chapters... I would buy it up in a heart beat. I feel that with everything in place, it wouldnt be THAT hard to actually implement a number of these ideas. To just bulk up each chapter more and fill it with lore, character development, and what not. Think any other FF. How there are a ton of major side things happening that the characters have to deal with on the way to each location. This game lets you skip all that. Which makes it feel rushed and copy and pasted. If they forced you off the beaten path on journey's that actually expand your horizon, they could add a lot of meat with little effort.",1

103,"Why was the DLC cancelled? 

I've head all the bad things about the Ardyn DLC and the books and the supposed retcons in them but why did they cancel the new DLC? FFXV is the second best selling FF ever not counting reeleases. It was obviously a huge commercial success. So why are they releasing mobile versions and Pocket Editions but no more story DLC? I can't believe it was to preserve the integrity of the plot. I mean, that is a nice thought, but I doubt it.

No spoilers please as I know nothing of the Ardyn, Gladio or Ignis DLC. Those are areas in the story I'm completely in the dark about. I barely even remember anything after Altissia.",1

I am playing the Windows Edition on Steam and due to the micro-stutter issue i downgraded the game back to ver 1.25.
I have finished the Angler's Nightmare quest (and i double-checked the completed quests list to be sure) some time ago.

The strange thing is when i fished at that specific location (where i caught Murk Grouper before for the quest), I saw a Murk Grouper mingle with the small fish. And i fished it out. Then after waiting in the camp nearby for the next morning, i found another Murk Grouper. 
Is it normal? I thought the Murk Grouper you caught for the Angler's Nightmare quest was the one and only Murk Grouper in the game. And after that you should be able to see the large blue dot representing the Dread Grouper taking its place. Somehow for me the Murk Grouper still lingers and Dread Grouper won't show up at all.",1

“hi square if one day u decided that u want to redeem yourselves due to hurting us with leaving ffxv a mess then why not re-release it or make a COMPLETE edition for next-gen consoles with this:

possible:
- HARD MODE
- bahamut summon
- all the DLCs
- revive the 2 festivals
- revive luna’s deleted cutscenes
- make kingsglaive watchable through an option
- add parting ways and DoTF novel through an option (make like an audiobook where the character themselves read it for u)
- EBONY LEVEL EDITOR. pls release what u promised
- maybe playable platinum demo? it’s part of the story right?
- add those damn mini-games from stadia. i know those games ain’t sh*t but still i want them
- also brotherhood. they free right? wouldn’t hurt to add them as watchable through that game itself now huh?

one could only hope:
- cartanica exploration
- tenebrae exploration
- more altissia exploration
- revive DoTF DLCs

or atleast make it like a royal pack or something so we could atleast finally get the final fantasy of our dreams

119,"The non-Chocobros Characters of FFXVLet me preface this by saying I'm new to FFXV insofar as I'm on my first run. Years ago I had no interest in playing it so I watched an LP. Eventually though I warmed up to what I saw and I got the game while it was on sale for Christmas on Steam.

I'm still heading to Altissia. Have been for about 20 hours and as many levels.  I know what is coming and so I don't want to leave. I want to just keep doing as many sidequests and stuff as possible. I'm gonna be looking into teh various ""Tours"" soon and then finally advance the plot.

I think everything to do with the four main characters and their dynamic is excellent and probably the ultimate selling point of the game. However I'm a long time FF fan and I think FFXV, while it avoids many pitfalls of FFXIII, follows in its footsteps in that it focuses 90% of the story on the main characters. It does a better job with side characters than FFXIII did but I still think it could have done more.

Take Iris for example. Dunno what the shipping scene is like in FFXV but Iris is a way better fit for Noctis than lunafreya. Actually having that time spent with Iris gives us a connection to her. Yet even that was too short. My memory was faulty from the LP I watched and she does not join the party as a FFXII style Guest like Larsa or Reddas. She's there for one dungeon maybe and that's it. I don't think it would have hurt the game at all to have her as a more long term guest. By all means keep it as just the four for the whole game as that is its greatest strength. But a guest to bring along for some sidequests would have been cool. I would have definitely liked to see more of Iris.

I know others feel the same way about Aranea who I am more indifferent to but it's the same principle. 

What do you all think?",1
120,"i absolutely loved ffxv...even though i cried a lil bit *SPOILERS*i just finished my first play through of the game, and i’m in love with it. i am by no means a video game connoisseur, but i can say that i really enjoyed it. i even cried like a baby at the end of the story. the gameplay, the storyline, the graphics, the combat, the weapons, and everything was amazing. i felt like i was part of the group. i ended up getting emotionally attached to the characters by the end of the story. i can say that this is the first game i’ve played that i’ve really connected  and engaged with. 

a couple things made sense to me after the story ended, like the logo. when you first load into the game, there’s a weird looking logo that has no relevance to the game whatsoever. until the final scene. when i realized that the logo was a picture of noctis and lady lunefraya sitting on the throne, i cried that much harder. in chapter 9, i think, sid drove noctis and his team to altissia via boat. he then said to trust in your friends, and never doubt them. the whole storyline highlighted the friendship between noctis and the others, forming a truly unbreakable bond that the player could relate to. i realized that when noctis was floating in space, defeating aldyn, ehat his friends were beside him. his friends must have fought the giants and died, coming to stand beside noctis even in death. they were with noctis, even till the very end(and then some). again, this made me cry even harder.  the significance of the pictures that prompto took throughout the story shone through. looking back through all the journeys and memories to find a photo, i started to cry. i wasn’t ready for the story to be over so soon, and i was attached to these characters. there was also other stuff that clicked after the game, but that would take be another couple pages to explain lmao 

i may be a baby for crying at this game. however, the character development that took place over the course of the game rendered me useless to being stone-faced. now, i’m gonna go back in time and go through all the side quests. thank you to all the creators of this story who made it truly connectable and engaging.",1

123,"Not a lot of games can make you cry like this one.Bruh.   


I am late to the party, it took me a long time to get XV for PC and even longer to play it, and then even longer to complete it. 

Honestly I've hated this game for the first half of the game, it's obviously a ""first try"" for the FF series in a lot of the things it does, the Open World aspect can be weird, the combat is sometimes sluggish and sometimes on point, the enemies just kinda stand there while you hammer on them and then attack you without feedback or anything.

The game isn't perfect, at all. But one thing always stood out to me: the relationship between the four main characters, every time I camped, every time we talked, every time they would come up with random quips at each other, or compliment each other's combat, it all was very unique for a game, so I stood around to see where the story went.

But that finale. That finale hit me so hard, from the moment you pick your picture from the ones you saved, to Regi dealing the final blow, the final camp scene. 

I cried like a baby through it all, I loved every moment of it, I can say that this game's journey was worth it, through all the ups and downs the boys were always there, and in the end it's because of their relationship that this game was elevated from being a game that I only wanted to ""get over with"" to see the story, to one of my favorite stories in recent JRPGs, to the point of wanting to find stories like it.

This might be my favorite most hated game.",1

after a long break I’ve decided to return to Eos and want to find out, what happened content-wise over the last 2 years.

I finished the game in 2017 with about 117 hours. I hit max level with all characters (120) and stopped playing around the time Comrades came out. I finished some of the post game dungeons (missing e.g. Costlemark tower) and still have some hunts to do.
I killed Naglfar and a high level mark on a military base (can’t remember the name).
I also finished Pitioss.
As I’ve discovered, a lot of content updates were released over the last 2 years. I have the official strategy guide, which is quite detailed but missed the updated content of course.

So I guess my question is, what are some of the biggest changes and new content that I should check out? I downloaded the Royal Pack FYI.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, that's a lot they added there.  So they completely abandoned the other three platforms, left them in an unfinished state, only to release it on Stadia with tons more functionality (and apparently cutscenes that were not in the main game.  Like I don't remember that Titan ground punch, but then again I never could summon him, so who knows.)

And doing that Magitek rush, if it's with your storyline Noctis, would be interesting.  Too bad it requires Stadia.

Or the voice acting!  Be it in Japanese, English, etc.

175,"For a first time FF player this game was a beautiful experienceI know I'm late to the party but I just played through FFXV Royal Edition, which I got earlier this week. Finished the main story and I liked it very much.

 The story is almost archetypal and in a way very simple, with parallels and almost stereotypical characters. But what made me like the game more, was how the relationships were built. I jumped into the game without watching any movies or reading any backstories, and I loved the way I just immediately was a part of this group of friends. They interacted with each other quite naturally and I truly felt their struggles and emotions, especially at the end. 

The carelessnes of the beginning turned quickly into a more serious quest, and at the end everything started to go downhill pretty fast. The game created a false sense of security with it's slow start and that's why I think every tragedy, fight and interaction between the guys felt more real towards the end. 

As I have read some online forums after completing the game, I've found people complaining over the convoluted and complicated plot, which makes me glad that I didn't dive into the lore too much. I didn't care about some plotholes that there may have been, because to me the story was rather simplistic in its core. So I might have a completely different perspective to this game, than some other fans who have spent hours upon hours catching up with the games lore, and that's fine to me. Great thing about literature, paintings, games, music or any kinds of art is that we can enjoy and interpret them subjectively. 

Of course this wasn't the worlds best game, that's obvious. But it's what I was searching for right now. Combat was interactive and fun, exploration was simple but rewarding, side quests or hunts didn't feel completely useless. The world was beautiful and diverse, and the story+characters were good. 

I don't really know as to why I wrote this, this game just really was the right game at the right time for me. I guess I just wanted to appreciate the good things that it did. After some time I'll probably dive more into the side content, altough right know going back to the camping and hunting wouldn't probably feel quite right. 

Altough this was a great experience I probably wont buy other FF games since the turn based combat is a major turn off for me. Also as far as I know they are quite different from this one aswell, altough as I've now gotten to know, they seem to be much more liked by the FF community, or atleast not as divisive.

194,"It was a really long journeyHello people,

After playing the unpatched game at its release on XB1 (without the DLC) and then playing the Windows Edition with Steam,

I can say i have finished the game and can uninstall after 241 hours and the 97 Achievements:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFweQbJV7iXY593p9xz9jnUmgWoVDVpjX5Lu5k6Ji5U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFweQbJV7iXY593p9xz9jnUmgWoVDVpjX5Lu5k6Ji5U/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a sheet in french i made for collection purpose

There are several things you will see I have that i shouldn't (Feather photo filter, Medjay Shield and Outfits, JM5 Sticker, Assassin's Stickers, Choco Sticker, and 2 Accessories)

I successfully added all the RED stuff too but it seems there is something that need to be checked in the savefile to confirm having them (Sims outfit, T-shirsts (I didn't preorder), Katana Dodanuki (Windows Store only), Cup Noodle Helmet)

I hope some will find it useful (after some translation) and bid you good game

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Comrades was a slog and i have some friend to thanks for the help to get through it BUT the story was really enjoyable (after several hours of grind after each bit of story)

195,"Unlocking the DatalogSo I beat FFXV way back when it first came out, and then I went slowly through each of the episodes and Comrades. Then I went back to play a New Game+ this week.

I knew that they had added a Datalog, and that players were advised to pick up as many pieces as they could without chapter select, because chapter select resets a lot of progress. There's only one problem - I have no Datalog (in spite of having a fully updated version of the game), and there seems to be no way to unlock it.

I went to the barrel in Hammerhead where there's one entry, there was nothing there. There was a Cosmogony book in Galdin Quay I could read, but it did not add any categories.

I've only just started Chapter 2 of this New Game+, but does it unlock later...? Or do I have to actively unlock it somehow?",1

So 2hrs plus means I obviously cant return it.  


So basically i see that people have had almost no issues on the origins version in comparison. My question is, if i delete the steam ID files in my steam folder of FFXV, could i buy the game on Origin and just use  the game files, or will I have to redownload the game entirely?

219,"New FFXV Mobile Scenario &amp; Gameplay Announced# [Promotional Image](https://i.imgur.com/MWUSqv4.png).

Korean developer [JSC Games](http://www.jscgames.com/) have announced today (via various news outlets, such as the [FNTimes](http://www.fntimes.com/html/view.php?ud=202001071305554049ee0209bd21_18), and [CSTimes](http://www.cstimes.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=326269)) that they are jointly developing the *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* (tentative name) with [GAEA](https://www.gaea.com/) and [Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group](https://www.opg.cn/cn/), based upon Square-Enix's *FINAL FANTASY XV*. The game will also be published by Shanghai Oriental Pearl for the Chinese market.^1

The new game has a few differences to the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* previously released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and most recently for Microsoft Windows. 

The story is set within another world parallel to the world of *FINAL FANTASY XV* and begins immediately after Prince Noctis and his retinue begin their journey. Players will become the protagonist and travel the world with friends in order to save it from various threats. Other new content will be included, such as the previously existing world map being expanded upon with new areas such as continents floating in the sky. 

Unlike the gameplay of original release of *FINAL FANTASY XV*, the new mobile game has been characterized as the following: 

&gt; * The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is being developed as a large-scale MMORPG using the Unreal Engine 4.
&gt; 
&gt; * They aim to go beyond the single-player scope of combat present in the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* by providing a variety of battles for players to cooperate with other players to complete.
&gt; 
&gt; * Gameplay involves simple touch controls.

Park Ji-young, CEO of JSC Games said, “The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is a game with an immersive story, fascinating characters, and it captures the unique sensibility of a Japanese RPG. We are committed to doing our best to bring both the action and graphics of the console experience to mobile.”

Additionally, a trailer will be released during the first half of this year, but an exact date has yet to be confirmed. 

No release date or comprehensive information about what regions the game will be released in has been announced.

She isn't a normal NPC model, but I don't recognize her. She's not Gentiana obviously, but I don't know who she is.

The game seems to crash any time you warp strike an enemy just as the battle ends (for example if you throw a magic and then warp strike an opponent, but the magic kills all the enemies just as the warp strike animation begins). It's really annoying, and this last time was the worst yet because it happened deep inside a dungeon, so it was a long time since the last save.

Is this a known bug with the game? I've played (and platinum'd) the game two times on the PS4, once at launch and once about a year ago, but I don't remember this ever happening before Stadia.",1

Is it like Monster Hunter, where it's all mission based, or is there an open-world bent to it? And lastly, how many players to a team?

From Ravatogh (the furthest west you can go in Lucis) to the gates of Insomnia (the furthest east you can go in Lucius), it’s listed as almost 7 miles. But you can spend almost/an entire in-game day doing that drive. It definitely wouldn’t take a day to drive 7 miles, especially if you drive as Noct and look at the dash, you can see they usually are going a decent speed. In the anime, it seems like Lestallum and Cape Caem are a few days apart, when you can do it in one day in the game (though the anime and game don’t always line up 100%.)
I’m curious if there’s any sense to be made about the travelling time and distance in the game, if there’s something lost in translation, or if it’s just video game logic you’re not meant to question, lol.

Am I right in thinking that, instead of buying the Royal Pack and Season Pass (currently $11.47 each), I’d get more content by actually buying the whole game again as the Royal Edition digital copy, currently available for $23.97? The price is about the same either way, although it seems like a bit of a waste to buy the base game again, plus I'd slightly prefer to use the disk instead of downloading the whole game (although I suppose I'd have to download the DLC content anyway...) - but I would prefer to get all the available content.

I am about to tell a story not so exciting, but I personally am moved to share this, because in real life, I cannot find any people appreciating this story, aside from my girlfriend, who is significantly the catalyst of this story. :)

I am an introvert.( This is my intro and its done ) Also have anxiety and depression. But I am fighting.

I am one of those who bought this game at day 1, pre-ordered deluxe version and played it around 2016 - 2017. Though I have never completed it 100% back then, I can say I was amused of the battle system and the ""lore"" it was trying to convey.

Like other players, I also felt the effect of the rushed and messy development of FFXV, feeling both great and hanging with the game's final cutscene.

Around late 2017-2018 I stopped caring and even playing like before, maybe got into it like 30 mins or 1 hr, because it bugged me to buy DLCs just to get a better experience ( this is not a rant, but please bear with my narrative ). So I decided to play the game, until I have a family ( which is not too far but right now still not doing progress about having my own family ).

I met my girlfriend around 2018, we have a very unique story, and we didnt meet like most couples do. We both played the risky game, painfully but courageously facing discoveries about each other \~ strengths and weaknesses alike. She is not a gamer, not even close to knowing some older games but that wasn't something that I saw her as a weakness in our relationship. It was a stereotype-breaker for me, finally meeting someone, someone entirely different, but reciprocating feelings and acceptance.

Fast forward to December of 2019. I decided to go back to her hometown, province, country side, lands are underdeveloped, the culture of people not sulking to internet, social media, and the feeling of genuine relationships and conversations without the pretext of social status, is very prevalent in her hometown. That is also something I dreamed of experiencing in this life of mine. (Lestallum is like where I came from, Insomia is comparable to where we usually work, and her hometown, is not far to Cape Caem's feel)

I understood, the moment I stepped to their land, people there, have different culture. The stereotypes in their culture vastly differs from my stereotypes. So I planned, my 5 days spent there, immersing myself in their culture and community, will be the best of the lifetime.

I brought my PS4, with only one game, FFXV. I didnt bring Tekken 7 because I am worried the little kids might be inspired being violent with one another, so yeah.

First day, I did not put on the PS4, because I am really anxious about her parents, and older siblings, not being ""accepting"" of the idea of playing a video game.. Her parents are both past 60+, and older siblings past 30+..

Second day, I put on the PS4, played Kingsgalive, and finally, my girlfriend was able to watch it, after almost 1 year and more of me trying to make her watch it.

Not only did she watch it, her dad, younger bro, and older sisters watched it.

She asked: "" So, whats gonna happen to the ring King Regis gave to Luna? ""

Me: "" Oh, we'll find out, when we play the game itself""

All my remaining days, we put time to play the game, no sidequests and hunts for now, only the main-line quests.

I was shocked, her Dad, her Mom, her siblings ( young and old ) and some other relatives, were hooked and more focused than I am. The fighting, made them excited, the monster designs, the world that FFXV was trying to convey, they were particularly appreciating it, not saying it perfect, but appreciating what IS than what coudve been. My girlfriend tried fishing, and riding chocobos, driving, and experienced the first few chapters.. We got until Fociaugh Hollow I think... 

Now I know why they put the line "" A FINAL FANTASY FOR FANS(me) and FIRST TIMERS(her and her family)""

They were more receptive of the story, of what the game has to offer, than me, a self-proclaimed gamer and fan of the franchise.

Now, I realized, I need to buy the Royal Pack, and the other DLCs for me to show them the complete experience the next time I visit their place, or having to experience the game with me and her having our own family.

It really gave the character great depth...more than the main game to be honest. The ending scenes hit me really hard after the Ravus boss fight. I really wished Square Enix continued to make the second wave of DLCs (most people probably won't agree with me on this but please let me know what you think) because the DLCs just got better and better. Episode Ardyn was pretty top-notch as well so I think Square Enix just knew what they were doing with these DLC lore and if they did release a second wave, I really think it would add a lot more to the main game.

265,"Crashes that seem to be fixed for everyone but not for meSo, I made a thread about this already. It was last year or something, long ago, I don't really know when and honestly I don't feel like searching for it again. I may have made two threads even.

These are my specs

* Windows 10 Pro
* Intel core i5 7600K 3.80 GHz
* 16 GB RAM
* NVIDIA 1060 GTX 6 GB RAM

I am running the game on 1920x1080 and with texture quality High, everything else is Low or disabled. I will say right away that at times, I was playing on everything high and everything low, kind of flip-flopping between them because I didn't know when the issue was still there or not, it occurs either way and here it is:

My game

1. crashes randomly for no apparent reason
2. runs perfectly at 60 FPS but in certain fights (I tried Naglfar just now and it crashed) the FPS drop down to like 10 for a few seconds before recovering, with struggling to do so.
3. Sometimes nothing really happens (the chocobros running or standing around, doesn't really matter) and the FPS drop down to 1 for a full second before going back to 60.

So I had these issues in the past already, around release of the PC version, and I tried asking people about it. People told me to use this ""Virtual Memory"" option that creates a pagefile.sys (It is 16 GB big right now, probably filled up while I was playing before it eventually crashed today) I enabled it and the issue seemed resolved.
Apparently it was because of a RAM leak?

But as I continued the game the issues just came back for no apparent reason. The memory leak issue kind of vanished for people and some of my friends even said that ""it was fixed"", but I don't seem to have any changes and my game crashes/lags still as much as it did on release.

When asking on reddit or people in the FFXV Discord people were like ""well, I speedrun the game and have no issue. It must be your system of some sort.""

Today I tried playing it again and was enjoying myself for about an hour or two until it just crashed again. I REALLY want to know why this is still going on for me and I can't wrap my head around it. Is my system outdated? I can play many other games just fine, including games that are newer. I don't know if its just the PC port having issues or my system at this point, really.

The real kicker for me was when my friend told me that he had ZERO issues playing the game: never crashed for him, never lagged for him. Constant 60 FPS without any trouble, smoothest experience ever, and his system is actually weaker. He had a GTX 960 (at the time) 12 gigabytes of RAM and Windows 7. He was running it on an HDD too. I just don't understand how he never had to deal with this stuff but I do.

So, does anybody have any idea what I can do or where I should start? I am just absolutely clueless now.",1

I got the two Update trophies fairly easily, then got through Gladiolus, Prompto (those freaking snowmobiles), and Ignis (friendly match bleh).  Finally finished up the Royal Edition trophy’s (Omega Weapon ONLY took an hour and a half).  This morning I booted up episode Ardyn hoping I could knock everything out in one shot...only to get an A rating instead of an A+.  So looks like I ha e one more play through on easy, then I’m officially done with FFXV.  I’m excited to finally do all the extra stuff, but I can’t lie and say I’m a little said to finish my second journey with the Chocobros.  I loved the game the first time through, and it’s been even better the second time.  I definitely feel like XV is going to go down as underrated.  I haven't enjoyed a Final Fantasy game this much since FFX, and I’ll never be able to hear Stand By Me the same way again.",1

Hoping someone can help me troubleshoot, so this is what happens on my system whenever I try fighting these monstrosities. Look at my temps and GPU/CPU usage when the stutters occur. I have tried basically any settings and this keeps happening seemingly randomly as some times (as you can see in video 1) everything is fine but some other times the power point mode turns on.

I enjoyed the original vanilla experience years ago, somewhat.

I was very psyched about getting a chance to play the game with all of its DLC episodes and new performance updates on PS4.

As usual the PS4 UI would ask upon download which of the many (+20) said DLC items I would like to install. Unfortunately, I was not aware the game would install some of the said add-ons in the Royal Edition without my consent. This includes unwanted DLC such as ""Item: Travel Set"", ""Item: Gourmand Set"", ""Item: Angler Set"", ""Booster Pack"" and ""Booster Pack+"", all of which I absolutely do not want to interfere with my gameplay experience.

The worst offenders being probably the Travel Set which cuts 50% off from all in-game hostel prices and fuel and somesuch ""travel expenses."" I have no intention to make the game any easier for me than it already was. If anything I'd prefer a way to make it more challenging.

This is supposed to be ""optional content"", but right now – for me – I can not find a way to get rid of said content.

I have tried deleting and reinstalling the game now countless times. I only seem to be able to control the installation of the larger DLC episodes, but not any of the previously mentioned files.

I've been in contact with my regional PlayStation customer support but they are not offering me any help to fix the license issue.

As far as I know, my PSN profile and thus the game is now forever tainted with said add-ons that cannot be undone if I wish to play the game in the latest 1.29.

If only I had bought all the wanted DLC individually **one by one** and perhaps I could've evaded this issue.

345,"Big FPS drop to 17 FPS locked in combat, until I wait a minute and it goes back to 70 FPS?Hi guys, just got back in the game after buying my new rig. It's running fairly smooth at 70 FPS on Ultra with Pure Light shaders, but sometimes I'll just enter a battle and it bogs down the game to 17-18 FPS and stays there, regardless of me pausing, alt-tabbing or killing every enemy. It just jumps staight from 70 to 17 FPS, and it takes about a minute before it climbs back up super-fast to 70 FPS.

It's not like I see my system dropping a couple of frames when a lot of stuff is happening on screen. It literally jumps from 70 to 17 instantly, and locks itself to that framerate. Luckily, it happens only a couple times per game session, but it's really bothering me.

What exactly is causing this to happen? I am hovering fairly close to my 8GB vRAM all the time, around 7.5GB, but my monitoring software doesn't record it breaking the 8GB, so I'm not sure that's the issue.

SETTINGS:

\- 1440p resolution, 120fps in settings

\- All Ultra, with VXAO off, lighting High instead of Very High, and Filtering to Low

\- ReShade with Pure Light preset (I tried toggling it off and on when the bug happens, and I stay locked at 17-18fps. It's not ReShade or a hardware performance issue....)

\- EDIT: I tried setting TRAM to High instead of Highest and that didn't fix the problem.

But I go to Cape Caem and the quest marker just marks an empty spot. Did I screw myself out of the final Engine Blade upgrade?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Nevermind, he's in Hammerhead. Not sure why the quest marker isn't anchored to Cid himself...",1
347,"Returning to FFXV, questions about Royal Edition and playthroughIve done so much searching on this topic my head is starting to spin and I couldn't really get the answers that I was looking for. My story, like many others, I completed the game and now am in Chapter 15 doing random stuff (2 dungeon keys left and Pitoss). Completed all other quests up to this point, have all the fish, all the dishes, all the hunts. So I've tried to do almost everything.  


Well, I now decided to buy the Royal Edition and have the dilemma that so many have asked about. How do I go play the new chapter 14. My understanding is that I have a few options but all of them have negative, please correct me if I'm wrong:  


1 - start a NG+ and play everything from scratch  
2 - use chapter select to start from chapter 14 and again I lose progress on a lot of stuff that Ive just recently completed in chapter 15  
3 - start the chapter 14 intro quest from chapter 15 but then miss out on loot, boss fight, cut scenes etc.  


Couple questions :  


A - if I do a NG+ or chapter select (my understanding these work the same way), will my list of fish caught, recipes all still be there?  
B - I think I might be looking at this issue all wrong with wanting to have everything on 1 save when in fact thats not really necessary. At the end of the day whats the lesser of 3 evils above? I've heard some say, do a chapter select, play the new chapter 14. Once done, go back to your ""main save"" and then go back and do chapter 14 again. This way you see the stuff from the chapter select that you'll miss but then your main save will have that stuff all completed as well.  


Does B above make the most sense with my thinking? Am I crazy in wanting to have 1 save that has all the stuff done on it? lol",1
348,"Yeah, sex is cool, but have you ever crafted a Potency 500 spell completely by accident?",1

Thanks!",1
350,"Any fix for a graphical glitches? (PC, Origin Ver.)",1
351,"Should I buy this game?I'm not a big fan of the Final Fantasy saga, but I think it's because I don't like turn-based combat. And just when they realized my desire to develop an FF action, they did it open-world.

I don't like open world games because they often take a long time to complete 100%, and I don't have much time to play.

I also know that FFXV has had a troubled development, and that this has ruined the final product. As if that wasn't enough, I seem to have understood that the last expected DLC has been canceled.

I don't have a gaming PC, but I have a PS4 Pro. Currently the Royal Edition on the PS Store is at € 17.49 (about $ 19.39 - £ 14.99).

Should I buy it or wait for the FFVII remake (which will be released in about 70 days)?

353,"Does thing just escalate super quickly past certain point?For the first 8 or so chapters I was so overwhelmed by the open-world, the number of annoying fetch quests and how high the level of the side quests are.

Then I got to Leviathan and everything became so straightforward and linear.

Am I playing the game wrongly or is this how it is??",1
354,"Does level relate to battle report cards?So I usually just Nixperience my way through the game, cause why not. This time I decided to actually try to 100% it and I figured being a decent level was important so the game would be less grindy. So I played all the way up to Altissia at lvl 1 and then took off the ring to get to 50.

Normally I get A+/As in Time and Finesse, and a perfect card every-so-often. And this is even with taking several minutes on mobs and constantly having to spam healing.

Ever since I hit 50 Ive been getting Ds and Cs on both, even when I quickly (less than a minute) finish a group almost exclusively with Parries and Link-Strikes.

So given that I meet/exceed the same performance criteria (and my overall performance just *looks* better), I was wondering if theres been any discussion or confirmation that level, or differences in level, effects the standards to which battles are graded. Or is this just in my head and Im actually doing worse, but cant tell cause Im stronger than the rest of the game now?",1

356,"Noticed a bug in the Power Plant.I went back in to do the hunts their, and near the end of killing the level 52 one, I noticed that for some reason Gladio refused to use his Downhammer tech. After the fight ended, I went into the menu to check if something was up and... I wasn't able to look at his gear. His name wasn't listed. When I backed out, I realized that Gladio didn't have an EXP wheel under him. It was as if he wasn't actually in the party, but was at the same time.

It fixed itself once I left, but I was curious- Has anyone else experience? I looked it up, and couldn't find any mentions of this bug.

&amp;#x200B;

361,"Specific DLC QuestionI beat the base game months ago but just bought the Royal Pack and Season Pass. I just finished Gladio's DLC and I feel, while fun, that it was extremely underwhelming. I will definitely be revisiting it to try fighting &gt;!Cor!&lt; again though, damn hes tough. I did have a good time though, I played it on normal and used all but two of my phoenix downs.

Are the Ignis and Ardyn DLCs this short too? My main question for this thread though is is the Ardyn DLC just as short or is it longer? I ask since it wasnt in the Season Pass. All of these are on sale for $2.50 each and for that price, these seem worth it (the season pass, which is, again, what I got was $7.49) but I dont think these would be worth $5 on their own. Ill probably still buy the Ardyn DLC before it goes back up to $5 anyway, but Im just wondering if it has more content than the other DLC stories do. Did these not sell very well and is that why they canceled the other DLCs?",1
362,"FF XV was so dark and depressingYesterday I finished the game and was surprised how dark it gets after chapter 9.

Ignis lost his eye sigh and never get it back.

The Fallen Empire who created the demons out of humans beings. The Entire Chapter 13 feel like Resident Evil to me.

That the World goes into the Eternal night and almost destroyed. I know that they same happens in FF VI but Eos in Ruin feels so much darker.

And the Ending when Noctis dies. I don't expected that this was mean with give your life for the throne. The after Credits Scene was also so sad...

I dont expected that after the beginning chapters that it get so dark but I really liked that and it was an incredible game. How did you all like this dark direction after chapter 9?",1

367,"To everyone having stuttering issues on PC Steam, could you please try this?I know it's boring and a waste of space and time, but if you guys are having problems with stuttering on Steam with FFXV, could you please try downloading the additional 4k texture pack? You don't even need to have it activated, you just have to download it and then try to play the game for a bit. 

I know this sounds like a weird solution, but on my PC it has almost entirely eliminated any stutter I had and game has become much smoother. I know it doesn't make sense but it's literally the only thing I've changed.

Some problems still persist though, like water attacks from the crocodiles near Galdin Quay tanked my FPS and GPU usage from locked 60 and 75% to 4-10 and 99%, causing many stutters.
I also suspect the frog spell from Nagas will still tank fps, and even the game loading the rainy environment, but I still have to test them.

If you guys try this, could you please report back?
Thanks in advance!",1
368,"Episode Duscae, can i still buy it with Type-0?Hi everyone. I know it's weird that someone still wants to play Episode Duscae now that we have the complete game and its Royal Edition. It's just that when Episode Duscae came out with Type-0 i didn't have my console, and i never played it until the full game came out. But FFXV is my favorite game, it's very special for me and i really want to play that older version in Episode Duscae. It's like a frustrated dream, haha.

374,"A Final Fantasy XV rediscoveryI’ve recently started playing FFXV after almost 2 years of not playing it/playing other games etc. And I have to say man what a great game it is! I remember being not too amazed by the story but the ending hit me right in the feelings because I loved them boys! The main cast is so good and they have such a great chemistry that I can’t help but like them. They’re definitely in my top 5 faves FF protagonists. Especially Noctis. He’s very likable and fun to play.
Anyway, rediscovering this game is being such a nice pleasure. It still looks really pretty, the gameplay is fun, and the world is believable. I’ve heard many people saying that the world isn’t believable but I disagree. Their argument was that since there are monsters around, why aren’t all the towns and outposts fenced or have walls? Simple, they are only afraid of the daemons. And to fend those off they just need the lights. And the regular wildlife is mostly there minding their own business. In case of regular animals attacks, hunters are a prominent presence in the FFXV world so I don’t see the problem! The world feels like it could be a real place most times and that’s probably why I can play 5hrs straight without noticing lol.
I also really love their design choices. The clothing in general is just so cool, and the weapons (even though most of them are medievalish weapons) are all techy and look like a sci-di version of their medieval counterparts. The towns look realistic and the panoramas are so beautiful! I love to use the regalia on auto and pan the camera to look at the landscape... Eos looks like a place where I’d want to go on vacation.

One thing that I still don’t like/care for is the fact that the important dlcs are paid when those parts of the story should’ve been in the game to begin with. I’m referring mostly to the Gladio/Prompto/Ignis dlcs. I wish they had put a cutscene at least that showed what happened. The game still stands on its own quite well, but I really wished they had put in a little something since the were going to make paid dlcs for those parts. Still, the main story is okay nonetheless.

Edit: I’m currently at chapter 3, exploring and doing side quests for fun.

Anyway, any of you rediscovering this game after a while? And what do you think of it?",1

\*Disclaimer: The Episode DLCs tend to have spoilers for the ending, so if it's your first time playing I'd definitely move those to the end.

\*\* Note: Dawn of the Future doesn't have an english version available yet. I just put it at the end based on what I read the story will be about.

Final thoughts: I haven't played since 2017. Back then my opinion was that this was a really good FF game, but suffered due to some terrible pacing and story telling in the back half. Obviously, the ending was as good as any in a game even back then in spite of the lacking second half. My opinion after replaying with all the content is that the story is as good as any other FF story as a whole, but is really held back by the fact that it's spread across entertainment mediums and requires making a guide on which order it should be experienced in. If Square Enix would've just cut the spoilers from the episode DLCs, inserted little prompts to play them in the right spot, and found a way to work the rest of this content into the actual game (e.g. replacing the opening cutscene with the omen trailer), then FFXV would go toe-to-toe with the greats in the series.

 i, of course had gotten spoiled that Sora dies, and from everyone's reactions i had expected it to be a bit more..sad.. or at least more dramatic...maybe like FFXV :P at least a little..

but what's funny is that i got spoiled that Noct dies when i was about half way through XV and i really expected it to be more vague and pretty much what happened in KH3.. not like getting stabbed in the heart 12 times and then off'd by your dad, before literally disintegrating! i did not expect that in the slightest and i was so shook (do people still use that word :P ) and i  think i had slight PTSD for at least 7 months after :P

so expectation subverted on both i guess? :P

i did really like KH3 and its ending tho! 

but FFXV is my game of the decade",1

My PS4 got stolen along with the physical hard CD of the game after I beat FFXV and only one of the downloadable DLCs (episodes).

Now I bought a used PS4, and was wondering about the current option next to the purchase of 'Take It Online +""  


So obviously I don't wanna play through the whole game again, but I do wanna play all the episodes and the royal pack expansion.

Do I need to buy the whole game again to play the DLCs, royal expansion, and Comrades? Or is PS Plus gonna substitute the original game for me?

I don't expect an answer, just kind of expressing my thoughts. I'm a completionist so this bothers me a lot however I don't want to do them offline by deleting updates. Hopefully and rightfully they should make it so if you have the trophies in the standalone you automatically get them in the DLC version which would make sense. They did the exact same thing but vice versa.

418,"Why had the Oracle to heal Noctis as a child instead of the crystal? (Spoiler for Ep. Ignis V2)I'm writing a fanfic and I started wondering why, after the daemon attack in Noct's childhood, he had to be taken to Tenebrae to be healed by Queen Sylva (this is assuming his injury was from the accident itself and that the daemon didn't infect him with any Daemon Juice ™, it's been a while since I saw both Brotherhood and Kingsglaive). But in Episode Ignis V2, Noct is able to save Ignis' life AND restore his eyesight with the crystal's power. If the crystal is that powerful, why couldn't Regis heal Noct himself using the crystal? 

Now, I get that Ep Iggy V2 isn't canon at all, and that FFXV generally has quite a number of plotholes (I say this with all the love in my heart, I adore this game), but I was wondering if anyone else has any thoughts about this, maybe an interpretation or a possible explanation?

Things felt disjointed, and apparently rushed as you progressed through the game, and though with the initial playthrough, I barely picked it up again after completing it for the first and final time. Since the release of Royal Edition, which I have downloaded, I always wondered about going back. I heard there was a decent amount of stuff added but I questioned whether or not it was worth it. Since it left a terrible taste in my mouth throughout all this time and with all the cut content that was taken away from the game since release, I always had this disappointment with Square. Though I can't blame Tabata on trying to get this game out and actually doing so. It's not that I hate the team that worked diligently on making ends meet but rather Square's upper management that ROYALLY screwed over this game. A crafted piece of art that could have been more but as a result became nothing more than a shadow to its light side.

I recently picked it up again and finished chapter 9. Finally the game grabbed me and I ended up finishing the rest of the chapters over the past week. This is instantly a classic Final Fantasy for me now. People seemed to not like it once the open world closed off and the story became more focused but that's exactly what I wanted.

482,"Is there a character that left an impression on you?I first apologise if another member has make a thread like this one or if this not an interesting topic, I only want to see what other avid players feel on the characters.

Which character from the Final Fantasy XV world has made a memorable impression on you? The answers can be from the main characters to the supporting/minor characters (e.g. Cor, Iris, Talcott, Sania Yeagre, Kenny Crow). I favor more than one character, though I list my top three:

* **Regis**, as I sympathize for the onerous weight on his shoulders. From losing his wife Aulea, to raising Noctis alone while defending Insomnia and the citizens. Seeing Regis do what he could to protect Noctis, the people of Insomnia, to Clarus in the battle against Glauca. I have pondered if Regis was ever informed who Ardyn truly was before his death and what Somnus has done to his brother.
* **Ardyn** is to me a sadistic and troglodyte character for abandoning his humanity to hurt people and Noctis who did not wrong him, though the story from Episode Ardyn and the notes from Dawn of the Future helps provide an explanation on why Ardyn is malicious toward the Caelum household. He suffered greatly to be forced in a fate that felt like a great deception, to heal the infected by absorbing the starscourge to being rejected by the Crystal and later told by Bahamut that his role was to shroud Eos in darkness. If I remember correctly Ardyn did not ever learn whether or not Aera was informed what was going to happen to him or whether Somnus knew of Ardyn's fate, so being left with unanswered questions placed a heavy sadness on the character.
* **Noctis** story is a tragic journey he was burdened with, as his fate to give his life for Eos was a cruel preordained decision from the Crystal. Each chapter in the game leading to the final battle was immersive to me and the many interesting people Noctis and his friends encountered were intriguing or amusing. The war with Nifelheim (and Ravus watching cautiously over his sister) was preventing Lunafreya and Noctis to see each other was hurtful, and I did sympathize with the pain Luna and Noctis felt. The only time the two can be together was in the mist of the battle, and that time was only brief and chaotic, no time for the couple to breathe. The bond with Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto and the obstacles that challenged their will and strength was a good example of brotherhood and friendship.",1

512,"The ""Dawn of the Future"" ending should have been the true ending*\* This is a major spolier, in case the flair wasn't enough!*

&amp;#x200B;

I don't read Japanese (yet!), so I didn't read it myself, but based on translations I found online, in the Dawn of the Future (the novel that tells the events of the 3 canceled DLCs) the ending is completely different, and it is SO MUCH better, for many reasons.

Here's a recap of the new ending from [FF Wiki](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Astral#cite_note-4) :

&gt;!Ardyn accumulates power too great for the True King to purge with the Ring of the Lucii, and Bahamut decides to go forth with his original plan of eradicating all life with Teraflare. Bahamut revives Lunafreya and tells her to gather the darkness into her own body and fell Ardyn, his plan to use the darkness itself to energize his ""final summoning.""Operating under the belief that her new calling will save Noctis, Lunafreya embarks to fulfill it, but comes to question the gods' benevolence after meeting Sol Antiquum, a daemon hunter who helps her get back to Lucis (she is also the daughter of Emperor Iedolas). Bahamut tries to stop Lunafreya from communing with Gentiana, but the latter manages to impart Bahamut's true intentions to her. Outraged at the revelation that Bahamut means to cleanse the Scourge from the planet by obliterating it, Lunafreya forges a new plan that defies his will.When Noctis sleeps inside the Crystal, the memories he receives let him understand how Lunafreya forging covenants with the Astrals was gradually killing her. Noctis makes it his mission to save her, and in the end, Bahamut absorbs her darkness to energize his Teraflare. It is blocked by the other Astrals and Noctis, Ardyn, the Lucii and the other Astrals cooperate to destroy Bahamut in both the physical and heavenly realms. As Bahamut is thus destroyed, Astrals and the Crystal itself dissipate, the Crystal purging the planet of the Scourge before shattering. As a final gift before fading, Gentiana heals Lunafreya, weakened as she is from her ordeal as a vessel for the darkness, and wishes her to live a happy life with Noctis.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, this should have been the game's ending, because :

1. The current ending breaks with Final Fantasy tradition. In every FF main title, the lesson is that the Gods, the ruling class, the government or any higher form of authority really cannot be trusted. The hero must always overcome some sort of identity crisis in order to defy this authoritarian regime. Fate, prophecies and god-given orders only serve to mask true intentions, and those true intentions are usually revealed near the end in a twist. In FFXV, the superior power is Bahamut and everybody just follow his commands. The prophecy he imagined simply unfurls. There is no twist.
2. Noctis is not currently a hero, but a martyr. By definition, a hero is someone who overcomes an obstacle or enemy, helping others in the process without expecting anything in return but sometimes also for personal motives nonetheless. In FFXV, Noctis does save the world and everybody in it, but he does so *in compliance* with Bahamut's teaching, and he doesn't have any personal motivation to do so aside from being told he has to. Yes, his father and girl were killed by Ardyn, but he doesn't appear to follow the prophecy in hope of avenging their deaths really, but simply because it is his destiny, his *Ascension*. Him dying at the end of that destiny doesn't make him a hero, but someone who suffered in order to ascend to a greater purpose. That is a martyr, exactly like Luna, like Yuna before her, and Aerith before all of them.
3. Ardyn was not meant to be the real villain of FFXV. He, too, is a victim of Bahamut. It is not explicitly mentioned in the lore, but Ardyn probably received his healing power from Bahamut, since the God gave a similar power to the Oracle bloodline afterward. But the daemons then made Ardyn both immortal and unworthy of the Crystal's blessing. So, what does Bahamut do ? He gives the crown to Ardyn's brother, a total dick and a mass murderer, who also killed his girl, the first Oracle. In Episode Ardyn, the God even implies that it was always suppose to happen this way, so that the prophecy can be realized. 2000 years later, Bahamut now wants Noctis to sacrifice himself to that end. Is that really how a benevolent God should behave ? Ardyn is like Sin in FFX, and Bahamut is like Yu Yevon : the first villain we meet is actually just a proxy. Bahamut sounds to me like a classic FF authoritarian figure thats begging to be overthrown, reminiscent of Bhunivelze in FFXIII. In fact, if you played the FFXIII trilogy (you brave, beautiful soul), you know that the ending of DotF is pretty much in line with the Fabula Nova Crystallis, in which the hero finds a way to summon and defeat a ultimate deity who wants to destroy the world so that some evil force (in this case, the Starscourge) can't ever reach him in his realm. That should have been the twist.
4. Luna finally becomes useful in this new ending. In the game, the Oracle seems dispensable to me. I get that the game needed a female lead, but clearly the story didn't. Noctis could have awaken the Gods by himself. Nifelheim invading his land and killing his dad could have been enough to motivate him. At the end of the day, the world got saved without Luna. Only in death, in the Beyond where Ardyn is sent, does she play a small role by restraining the villain for a second with some light until Noctis unleashes his final attack. Her only other task was to give Noctis the Ring, but she doesn't even manages that, since Ignis actually gives him the Ring. Noctis and Luna don't even speak in person during the entire gameplay. Yet, the [painting of the prophecy](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/True_King?file=FFXV_Genesis.png) places her at the very top. I'm 99% sure the girl in that painting was meant to be Etro, the Goddess that created mankind in the Fabula Nova Crystallis. In Versus XIII, Luna's previous iteration, called [Stella](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Stella_Nox_Fleuret), talked about the ability to see the realm of the dead, which is basically the twist of XIII, since thats where Etro is trapped. Anyway, all of this to say that the new ending changes this dynamic for the better. After being killed in the most predictable manner by the villain, having Luna come back is already a great plot twist, but having her defy the superior authority of Bahamut and truly help save the day does even more than that : it makes her finally worthy of being the game's logo.
5. Finally, this ending ties up some loose ends in the story. Obvious cuts in the game development made the narrative difficult to embrace at first, and even today, piecing it all together is still a laborious process. FFXV was meant to be a part of its own universe, so the game doesn't contain all of its own lore, far from that. I would argue that Kingsglaive, the prequel movie, contributes more to the general narrative than the game, as it better positions everybody for the coming event. Too bad we can't rewrite beginnings too, 'cause that movie should have also been the start of the game, with Noctis as the lead. Anyway, this new ending finally gives proper roles to the women of this title. Not just Luna. Together with Sol, the new girl, Aranea offers a human perpective on Nifelheim and its people, one that makes it difficult to see them as purely evil afterward. Gentiana also defies Bahamut, her superior, to save Luna and Noctis so that they can be a couple, like she and Ifrit used to be. And finally, Noctis, our hero, becomes worthy of that title, by refusing to simply follow orders, by tracing his own fate, with the help of his party, in order to save the world. You know, like in a Final Fantasy game.",1

If each royal arm disappears after collecting its power, then how have previous kings collected them?

This is the first game in the franchise I've played, and the only other non-Pokemon / Mario JRPGs I've played are Octopath Traveller and Xenoblade 2. The ladder of which took me up until probably half way through the game to wrap my head around the mechanics. And this is kind of starting off even more confusing. Rather than starting off with one party member and gaining them over time, I have to figure out how to use and manage four at once. I don't know if I'm supposed to just ignore them, or keep track of them in battle, or what. Most battles I just hold in the attack button and hope for the best, as I have no idea what advantages the different weapon types would give me, and I absolutely suck at timing parries for some reason. And how should I handle world traversal? There's an absolute ton of land, but most of it is empty space. Should I even bother exploring by foot, or should I just go where the mission marker tells me to go so I don't risk spending hours aimlessly wandering through a desert wasteland that wasn't actually designed to have anything worthwhile like enemies or secrets? For reference, I just got to the beach after the motel delivery, and I'm playing on Stadia.",1

590,"I just completed the final dungeon... but now I want to shoot myself (Spoiler!)I just completed Pitioss. Took me 3 hours (Call me stupid I don’t care, I tried my best and it took me that long). I got outside, snagged my black hood, opened the menu, and clicked “return to car.” I then proceeded to fly my car into the wall upon takeoff, getting the “GAME OVER” screen. I clicked return to last save, and I was at the campsite before pitioss.

591,"Pitioss Ruins [slight spoiler] - am I going to have to go all the way through again?OK so I got all the way to the last room. It took me more time than I care to share. Before grabbing the hood, I fell off a short ledge back down to the first room where the sphere is. I think there was a mask I could have smashed to be able to go back, but I didn’t get it. Am I going to have to go back through the whole thing again? Halp!",1
592,"What's with the complaints about the Steam version?For the longest time, I was holding off on buying FFXV on Steam, because I heard that it has some issues not present in the other versions. I would see posts everywhere saying that it would have frequent stuttering, crashes, etc.. BOY were they wrong. I seriously can't fathom why anyone would complain. I have been playing for 30 hours already, and the only stuttering I ever saw was during a fight with &gt;10 enemies near a lake, and even then the fps only dropped by \~3-5. As for the rumored ""crashes"", I haven't had a single one in all of my hours of play. I'm getting stable 60fps with all settings maxed, Hairworks ON (other Nvidia options off) on an RTX 2070 Super. Whatever issues people have been having with the Steam version of this game, I sure as heck haven't seen any.",1

594,"Favorite PS4 Pro Mode 2019?I got to say, I think Steady is my favorite. 

On High, the scaling and changing resolution makes things look disjointed and the characters dont look like they belong in the same lighting environment. 

Originally this was designed as a PS3 game. So my assumption is that the art and stuff was all intended to run in a lower resolution and when upscaling it everything looks smooth but also weird. Plus frame issues

Oh Lite, it’s pretty nice but I’d rather have a stable 30fps for this game as opposed to 60 with it stuttering all the time.",1
595,"Chapter 13 Noctis or Gladio &amp; Ignis?I've just defeated Uttu on the level ""Prompto"" is at, and now have access to level 3. Is it worth changing over to Gladio &amp; Ignis? Noctis is only at level 35 and not the recommended 39. Will I lose all progress/weapons/character stats switching routes?!

601,"Getting back into this, not sure where to start...Well, it’s been a couple of years since I dove into FFXV. FOr some reason, playing Death Stranding really makes me want to play FFXV... 

Onwards, I have a save file where I beat the game, but I have yet to do a lot of the end game stuff. Adamantoise and one last armored.  I have 12/13. 

I played FFXV and beat it before the royal pack. I hear they’ve added some new stuff and story changes as well. 

I’m really wondering a couple of things,

1. Should I just keep playing my current file and finishing the game and all of my extra side quests? Will I get to experience all of the added content?

2. Should I just start over and do new game plus? I am interested in experiencing the story again... but not too excited about having to do all the side quests over. 

3.  Should I just go fresh for a new game with all of the content added? 

4. I have Ardyn, the only dlc I haven’t played, should I save it until I’m done with the rest of the game and comrades? 

5. Isn’t there a book that came out? Is there any lore or content I’m missing? 


Thanks again for anyone who can clarify these things for me. 

I don’t mind just continuing my current game. But I won’t see some of Net he story changes etc. and I kinda wanted to experience the game fresh again...

Does anyone know if you’re side missions stay complete

Its not the keyboard/gamepad stuttering issue, which i already disabled with Special K mod. The framerate is always stable, only some occasional glitchy stutter during combat(not typical frame drop), this stutter is different from the freeze i mentioned above.

Specs are: R5 3600, 2080 TI, Windows 10, 32GB ram

Does anyone else encounter this?

BTW, what does this ""miss"" means in the picture below(Special K mod interface)?

643,"Can someone explain the ending with evidence/facts?Finished the story a second time but still did not understand the ending properly even with all DLC played.

1) Why does killing Ardyn remove the entire Starscourge from the planet? The Daemons existed before Ardyn existed and also existed before he was corrupted by absorbing the ""disease"" from the victims. So why does killing Ardyn has any effect on the miasma in the atmosphere disappearing and the all daemons getting cleansed. It's ok to say when the light returns to the planet all daemons outside get killed but there is a chance a few daemons can hide in the shadows and survive. According to the game the miasma comes from the daemons, so basically all of that could happen again?

2) What actually happened when Noctis summoned the old kings of Yore including his father in the final scene? Many sources state they're supposed to kill Noctis to ""go into his body"" so that he brings them to the ""beyond"" dimension with him where Ardyn is going to be after getting killed (and before he revives). I don't get why this is necessary. Isn't the Ring of the Lucii supposed to ""house"" the souls of all the kings and isn't Noctis going there as well when he gets stabbed and dies. If Noctis soul is not going into the Ring then I'd guess he summons the kings' souls from the ring to go into his body but then why is the Ring glowing so much all that? Shouldn't the Ring be ""empty"" and mightless?

3) According to the english subtitles and the proper japanese dub translation (thanks to [spelldaggers.wordpress.com](https://spelldaggers.wordpress.com)): During the final campscene Noctis is saying its too much for him to handle / hurts seeing all of them together camping again which makes him feel really nostalgic. He also said he was prepared during the 10 years in the crystal/made his peace that he knows he's going to die (?) saving the world but this whole campfire-situation with the nostalgic atmosphwere makes him really sad(?). Did his bros also know? If yes how did they know? I cannot remember someone telling them this. Only Bahamut revealed to Noctis he has to die but that was when Noctis got sucked into the crystal. 

4) When Ignis said ""Glad to hear..."" I was like wut - why are you glad Noct is hurting seeing all of them together like this? Does that mean everyone actually feels the same way as Noctis and are glad that Noctis actually said it out loud and got confirmation he also feels this way which they did not know for sure since he's so awkward with his feelings? Does this imply they know that all of them might die and this is the last campfire or are they sad its the last one because noct is going to die?

650,"PS4 disc drive died. If I buy the digital version can I keep my saves easily?I can’t open the game anymore since it can never see I have the disc inserted. 😢 Does anyone know if I can just buy the digital version, install it, and still have my old saves? If not, could I do it by backing my saves up to a usb stick first? Also, not that I expect one, but is there a way to get a discount on the digital version if I bought the disc version in the past? I got the disc near release and then bought all the DLC’s if that matters for anything.

651,"(Spoiler) What would the journey be like without one of the bros? Do you think it would end early, or would they make it until the end?Title. Aside from Noctis since he’s required for the prophecy, what would you expect the journey to be like if one of the bros wasn’t present? Including their relationship due to missing a character, plus chapter 9/timeskip. Same scenario from the main game plays out. Spoilers! 

- **Gladiolus:** since he’s not here, I would imagine that the workload increases much more on Ignis’ part. Almost to the point of being a full time mom watching over two children (ok, not to that extent, but Prompto and Noctis certainly share a sibling like bond). The journey would be a little more light hearted but stress inducing because you don’t have someone with physical prowess on your side anymore, so they’d have to tread lightly while being hunted by Niflheim or when encountering monsters. Seeing how Gladiolus used to be the one to try and get Noctis on Ignis’ good side, Prompto would likely replace him as the mediator instead. Ignis would likely be more agitated with needing to come up with more strategies to get them by, but somewhat satisfied for being needed. In this instance, I’d also believe that Ignis would form a bond with Aranea, because he would be watching over two people he trusts similar to how she trusts Biggs and Wedge (plus, the dragoon like abilities). She’d probably make a sarcastic remark here or there but encourages Ignis to do his best. During the events of chapter 9 is when the light hearted tone comes to a close. Noctis is trying his best against Leviathan and Prompto is panicking while relying on Ignis to help evacuate the citizens. It’s here where if Episode Ignis still played out the same way, Prompto would be forced to have a change of heart and develop leadership abilities as well as courage that he wouldn’t have until the timeskip. It would also fit the theme of having to make a tough choice, as Ignis made one to save Noctis and Noctis later does the same in chapter 13. If Prompto had more of a courageous and steadfast character from here on out, I could buy players not being able to tell the difference between him and Ardyn during the train scene. But to take it back for a second, as soon as Ignis goes blind is when things become more tense. The dynamic suddenly changes with Prompto likely blaming himself and Noctis for not being able to help out Ignis. Noctis takes it personal and argues with Prompto and would likely bring up Luna’s death against him. It’s here where Ignis snaps them both out of it. However, since there isn’t someone to keep pushing them forward, I could see the group going their separate ways from here. But let’s assume they repair the relationship between themselves. On the train ride to Gralea, Ardyn would likely have Prompto take Gladiolus’ role and not have Noctis hit Prompto off of the train. Chapter 13 still plays as usual, only with Prompto becoming more hardened to threats due to Ignis’ condition as well as him being needed. I can’t say for sure if just the two of them would be able to last those hordes of demons while Noctis has to race for the crystal. In the event that they do, the timeskip happens as normal except Noctis still takes it hard knowing that Ignis never recovered properly. Prompto at this point is effectively Gladiolus with only a slight joke here and there but is much more serious due to the circumstances they face 10 years later. While they go back to Insomnia, the three would recall better times but have no regrets about the events that led up to this point. They instead remember the dynamic between them and make references to it while making their way towards Ardyn. Noctis fulfills the prophecy, but this would probably lead to the most tragic ending since it would give off a “mother losing her children” vibe, as Noctis dies and Prompto doesn’t have a regular lifespan due to being a clone. After a period of time Ignis would be the only one remaining. 

- **Prompto:** without Prompto, the light tone of the group goes away since they’re not very lighthearted to begin with. Sure, you have jokes here or there but without Prompto I would argue that this time they would be devoted to getting to Altissia and later fulfilling the prophecy. It would be more of a fatherly/motherly relationship with Gladiolus and Ignis in regards to getting Noctis to do what he needs to. Because Prompto isn’t here, the journey would also feel less sentimental and more focused on duty. And instead of Ignis being stressed this time around (although he would, just for different reasons) Noctis would be the one under immense stress because he has no one to relax around. He does trust Gladiolus and Ignis, but it’s not the same sort of relationship he has with Prompto. So instead it would be him being furious about his duty and constantly being reminded about what to do. The strain between Noctis and Ignis would become worse, except this time Gladiolus would be the one to mend wounds between them. However, instead of being someone that Noctis would vent to, he would try to cheer up Noctis or try to get him to do things that would get Ignis off of his back (see racing tour at Galdin). They would stop at a few spots that would catch Noctis’ eye (or if Ignis encourages it) but otherwise keep moving forward to Altissia. Gladiolus gets injured again by Ravus and the same scenario plays out when he leaves. This time, Noctis would be forced to cooperate with Ignis as they search for the Mythril. Aranea shows up again, but instead of bonding with Ignis she tells Noctis in a rather blunt fashion that he needs to listen to Ignis if things want to get better between them. She helps them with a hard fought battle against the Quetzalcoatl and all else proceeds normally when Gladiolus returns. When they arrive to Altissia, Cid would likely remind Noctis that from that point on, Gladiolus and Ignis are the ones he should trust most. During the events of Episode Ignis, Gladiolus would be doing his own thing similar to how Ignis was fending off Niflheim. Except he would arrive too late to see Ignis and Noctis injured. Because of his minor relation to Ignis and Gladiolus, I could see Ravus accompanying the group this time around to Gralea instead of traveling by himself. Noctis and Gladiolus duke it out again, except it’s almost physical this time because of how hard all three of them fought in Altissia only to lose so much. Because of this, Gladiolus becomes even more serious from this point onward and with Ignis being blind, I could also see the group splitting up for various reasons. One that stands out the most would be Noctis’ distrust of Ravus even though Ravus had a change of heart but Ignis defends Ravus. So while the group would still be tense because of Ignis’ injury and Ravus’ entry, they would eventually work past their differences and vow to fulfill the prophecy. At this point, Gladiolus and Ravus would also develop respect for one another. On the ride to Tenebrae, Ardyn would probably kidnap Ignis to force Noctis to come to Gralea (which is technically what happened in Episode Ignis, Verse 2 as Ardyn wanted a reason to force Noctis to ascend). Ravus would then explain what happened to the capital and because of his knowledge, he would lead the group to a faster way to Ignis. Once Ignis is rescued, they would fend off demons once more while Noctis heads for the crystal. In this instance, the Emperor would be among that horde wanting to slay Gladiolus, Ignis and Ravus trying to stop Noctis. When the timeskip happens, Ignis and Ravus discuss what Tenebrae was like before Niflheim took over, and Ravus wishes to see the sun rise over it again. Because no one stopped Verstael 10 years ago, Ardyn would have had a corrupted version of Immortalis waiting for the trio and Noctis would’ve had to use the might of the Six to stop it. After it’s defeated, Ravus joins once more to help Noctis fulfill his calling. While in Insomnia, Ravus apologizes to Noctis for the destruction of his homeland and Noctis ignores it, likely saying that Tenebrae fell before it and none of his ancestors were able to stop it. With this in mind, he has the vow of opening up Lucis to all, regardless of birth or circumstances. Ardyn at this point would likely toy with Gladiolus, Ignis and Ravus to enrage Noctis before fighting him. Ardyn is defeated, and before Noctis dies he would thank Gladiolus and Ignis for always having his back even at the worst times and promises to keep Luna happy for Ravus. Noctis dies, and the remaining group watches the sun rise once more. I wouldn’t find this a very tragic ending as opposed to Gladiolus not being there, if only because all three of them would live (in my opinion) and while you do lose out on the value of photos, you could at least recall the events that led up to that point. Assuming Ardyn would make use of Immortalis, he would also threat what little outposts were left to use against Noctis. 

- **Ignis:** and finally, without Ignis the group would change completely. It would be more of a “my best friends and I” feel because there’s no one to constantly remind them of their duty and Gladiolus did want to see what life was like beyond Insomnia. I get a strong feeling that it would be more of a comedy between all three, fun for everyone. It wouldn’t be all fun and games though, since they would struggle immensely. For one, as far as I know Ignis is the only one that can cook. They would struggle with camping, so I could see them trying to replicate a few Hunter recipes to get them by or Cup Noodles. Another reason would be that Noctis has a history of being a bad driver at times, so they would have to cover for expenses if they weren’t careful enough. With no one to manage expenses either, I could also see Noctis and Prompto going crazy with money until Gladiolus puts a stop to it (or vice versa if Gladiolus sees something he wants but doesn’t need). While Gladiolus and Prompto give Noctis strategies, it probably wouldn’t be as effective if one was advised by Ignis. However, Gladiolus knows the lay of the land so he would probably take over for Ignis when it comes to knowing when or how to attack an enemy. As for breaking into strongholds, I could see them enlisting the help of the hunters should things go south while Noctis tries to scout for any threats while infiltrating. Speaking of infiltrating, when Ravus shows up Gladiolus still loses yet again, but in this scenario I would imagine that he doesn’t leave on his journey because leaving Noctis and Prompto on their own is dangerous. It’s because of this that he goes from being a jokester to being frustrated, paranoid and serious that he can’t do his job properly. From here on out, he swears that he’ll never fall to his knees again. So while Noctis and Prompto deal with Gladiolus’ change in personality, they would all head to get Mythril while Aranea pokes fun at Gladiolus. When they acquire Mythril, they ask if she wants to be part of the crew, but she would retort that they wouldn’t have enough money to ever hire her. Before they set sail to Altissia, Cor would apologize as he always does except he notices something off about Gladiolus. So in return, he accompanies them to Altissia. Along the way, Noctis and Prompto are doing their own thing while trying to get used to the serious tone and someone even more serious. Cor would advise Gladiolus to not get hung up on his past failures and to keep moving forward. When they arrive, there would be little time for sightseeing as Cor reminds Noctis that Luna is in town, preparing for the covenant with Leviathan. Noctis would ignore this and hope to see Luna again. The rite happens again, except Cor takes the role of Ignis in Episode Ignis. He would spend time fending off Niflheim while Gladiolus and Prompto evacuate the citizens. Cor would then encounter Ravus, who shows visible anger towards Cor, but Cor also sees that it’s not him that Ravus is after. The two decide to have an uneasy alliance since Cor swore to protect the king. The bickering is also the same, except Cor reminding Ravus to stay focused on his goal. Since Ravus has no respect for Cor like he did Ignis, he would be much more angry at Luna’s death, resulting in a fierce battle between him and Cor with Cor eventually gaining the upper hand at the cost of being exhausted. Ardyn shows up once more to subdue both him and Ravus. Instead of trying to take someone immediately to Gralea to force Noctis to ascend, Ardyn would toy with Cor specifically to see if his moniker (the Immortal) holds weight to his name. Ardyn duels with Cor, easily gaining the upper hand due to his demonic powers. Ravus steps in but even after catching Ardyn off guard Ardyn quickly disposes of him as well. Just before Ardyn seems to land what would be a fatal blow on Noctis, Cor unleashes the last of his strength to take the hit, leaving a massive wound on his *back.* Gladiolus and Prompto finally show up to see Ravus sprawled out and Ardyn ordering imperial soldiers to take Cor instead to Gralea. From here on out is when things get stressful for the group. Gladiolus, ashamed for not being able to protect Noctis for a second time and with not much to show for it (aside from evacuating the citizens) tries as best as he can to muster up composure and to get Noctis to go to Gralea while trying to get over Luna’s death. He would tell Noctis that the past already happened, but Noctis would take it personal and call out Gladiolus for acting weird ever since he lost to Ravus. Gladiolus moves in to strike Noctis but Prompto intervenes and takes the blow instead. Gladiolus is shocked and tries to help Prompto, but Prompto says it’s ok and reminds them that they can’t stop now since Cor was captured. Gladiolus storms off because of Noctis and Noctis tries to help Prompto. On the train ride, Prompto comforts Noctis about Luna’s death and reveals to him what happened in his childhood involving him and Pryna. He also mentions to Noctis to try and not take it so personal with Gladiolus, because he’s also been trying his best. After receiving Katana of the Warrior, things are still tense between the two but they both look at each other and agree to move forward, for now. Meanwhile, Ardyn is having fun torturing Cor to see if Cor is as tough as they say. During this, he also questions Cor’s unwavering loyalty and taunts him about failing to protect Regis. Cor looks at him and says he managed to protect what the king wanted safe, angering Ardyn. Ardyn leaves Cor to rot while he prepares for the arrival of Noctis. Same scenario plays out but in this instance Ardyn wouldn’t give Gladiolus or Prompto their weapons back, taunting them about being too incapable to help Noctis. Along the way, Noctis gets ambushed by the Emperor and is forced to flee. Right as he’s back into a corner, he suddenly regains use of his powers again. He fends off the Emperor until it’s cut down by someone else: Ravus. As it turns out, Ravus was the one that disabled the machine preventing the three from summoning weapons. From this point on, Ravus assists Noctis in trying to help find Cor and getting to the crystal. Eventually, they would meet up with Gladiolus and Prompto and make their way to Cor. When they locate Cor, they find him strung up along with cuts and bruises all over his upper body. Horrified, Noctis frees him and asks if he’s still ok. Cor says he’s fine and is glad that Noctis is still ok. Gladiolus at this point finally loses it and breaks down in anger at the sight of Cor, wondering if he’s really worthy of being the King’s Shield. Cor chastises him, and said that so long as Noctis was still breathing he was still worthy of his duty. Ravus, impressed by the devotion of these men, tells Noctis that their sacrifices should not be in vain and hands him Regis’ sword. Noctis then vows to stop Ardyn. They make their way to the crystal, where they fight a horde of demons once more while Noctis races to the crystal. Except this time, it’s high stakes due to Cor being too injured to fight, so Prompto protects him with everything he has while Gladiolus and Ravus fight with all of their might. Realizing that keeping Cor around might lead to their deaths, Ravus orders Gladiolus, Prompto and Cor to escape while he holds off the demons. Gladiolus asks him if he’s crazy, but Ravus replies that he’s now willing to do anything to keep the king safe, and that Gladiolus should do the same. They flee while watching Ravus go out in a blaze of glory in the name of his pride, his king and for Tenebrae. Timeskip happens, but Cor is more of a mentor than an active participant due to his injuries and teaches Gladiolus and Prompto how to survive. Gladiolus decides that after what Cor and Ravus did for Noctis, it’s his time to step up and truly show if he’s worthy for the title of King’s shield. Cor understands this, and hands Gladiolus his sword while Gladiolus goes to complete the Bladekeeper’s Trial. Gilgamesh would be yet another character to taunt Gladiolus of his failures, except Gladiolus is reminded of how much Cor and Ravus put on the line for Noctis so he moves forward, regardless of what may come. Gilgamesh is impressed at his resolve and dares Gladiolus to come seek glory. Gladiolus completes the Bladekeeper’s Trial and reports to Cor. Cor is proud that Gladiolus was able to do what Clarus could not, and tells Gladiolus that he can keep both of his swords as he won’t be needing them anymore. The rest would be up to Gladiolus. Noctis awakens, meets Gladiolus and Prompto before speaking to Cor at Hammerhead. Noctis thanks Cor for everything he’s done, but Cor nods and says that he should really thank the two behind him. The trio then progress to Insomnia. Along the way, Noctis thinks about everything that happened and swears not to let Lunafreya and Ravus dying be in vain. Before heading up to confront Ardyn once and for all, Noctis stops Gladiolus and Prompto and tells them that they mean more to him than they could know. Gladiolus and Prompto respond by looking at Noctis and laughing hysterically, saying that he’s certainly grown the past 10 years. Noctis counters by saying the same about Prompto, to which Prompto retorts that he couldn’t be the one left behind while everyone else was fighting. Gladiolus then gives Noctis Cor’s sword, and says to give one to Ardyn on his behalf. Noctis dies, the sun rises up once more. Gladiolus and Prompto watch as Prompto tries his best not to break down, along with Gladiolus. Ravus is seen smiling and wishing Lunafreya the best while the sun rises again over Tenebrae. 

So what do you think? Agree or disagree? If the latter, how do you think it would play out? Would it end prematurely?",1

680,"About to rebuy. Questions about which version to get.My PS4 copy was stolen about a year ago and I'm really itching to replay. I have a PS4 Pro hooked up to a 4k tv with HDR (FF15 was actually why I upgraded to the pro) and I remember the performance was actually pretty respectable apart from the frame pacing. 

Conversely, my PC currently has a GTX 970 with 8gb ram hooked up to a 1440p monitor. I feel like the trade-off would be slightly better performance for the sake of a fairly noticable drop in image quality, especially for playing in 1440p where I'd likely have to lower some settings. I'm not a super techy guy, but does that sound about right?

I'm trying to play with Japanese VA and Spanish text/subtitles. Is that doable with both versions?

Is there any kind of mod scene for the PC version that might tip the scales toward that version?

I remember when the game first came out, the combat kind of threw me off. I was expecting a proper action-style combat system instead of the hold-the-button-down-to-countinously-attack thing. Did they ever add an option to turn off the auto-attacking and dodging?

I appreciate any input. I actually had a ton of fun with FF15 despite it's plot shortcomings. Anyway, looking forward to what you guys have to say!",1
681,"New Game+ Costlemark Dungeon IssueSo I've been looking around past posts about this issue but none have really answered or fixed it for me. 

I am on my NG+, well past finishing main story quests, and in the main puzzle room in Costlemark. I've activated the first nexus cube puzzle, but now none of the other cubes will activate. I've spent hours in here trying to get something to trigger. I've turned my PS4 off, cleaned the disk, reloaded the previous save to access it in a different file. Nada.

Either way I'm wondering, at my current place in the game would anyone know if it would be worth it to start the dlc at this point? The reason I am so clueless is because someone actually dumped it on my husband because they didn't think they'd have time for it. I ended up taking off with it instead. Now I'm so far ahead of him and I come here because I can't really talk to him about it and it gets tough sometimes no not share even though our whole family geeks over this game.

686,"Gladio’s dad (and a few other Kingsglaive questions)1. I just rewatched Kingsglaive after finishing the main game, and now knowing that Clarus was Gladio’s dad, I’m wondering something. On the day that Insomnia fell, Gladio lost his dad too, not just Noctis. And I’m sure Ignis had family in the city, too, but we know specifically that Clarus died while protecting the king. So why is it not mentioned after the gang learns about the city falling? Noctis mourns his dad’s death and the other guys support him, but no one says anything about Gladio’s dad dying. I find it odd that the devs didn’t include any dialogue mentioning it, not even just a couple lines.

2. The Empire worked so hard to fell Insomnia, so why did they leave it unoccupied afterwards? It’s a massive city with expansive resources, I don’t understand why they would destroy the city and then abandon it, instead of taking it over and the surrounding territories and expanding Niflheim’s rule.

3. In the end fight scene when Libertus drives away and Nyx is riding on the shoulder of one of the old kings, is it Regis? I tried to determine which royal arm he was wielding but I couldn’t distinguish it.

4. I’m a little disappointed that Libertus didn’t make any kind of appearance in the main game. Other than Luna, he was the only other main character that survived, so I figured he would have made some kind of appearance. Even Nyx was seen, granted it was his body hanging in the throne room along with Regis and Luna in chapter 14.

5. Not a question, but I noticed that both the movie and the main game ended with the sun rising at dawn after someone’s sacrifice. Just thought that was a cool addition that gave a better feel of connection and continuity between both.",1

I recently picked up this game again and am looking into Timed Quests for the first time. Until now I'd never completed one, and everything I read talks about how the first completion of the Cactuar timed quest gives 100K XP, 150K gil, and 333AP. Except none of those rewards show up for me when I look at the timed quest, and after completing it for the first time, I didn't get any of those extra rewards.

I went through and manually changed my date to every variant of the Cactuar timed quest and none of them had any bonus rewards: all they list is 100QP. I know I didn't do the quest beforehand because I have exactly 100QP from completing this quest once.

FFXV just came in at the right time and hit all the right notes. If somebody made a game and I was guaranteed to enjoy it as much as FFXV, I would gladly drop a couple hundred bucks on it.  Here's to the memories!  

November-December 2016 was a damn good time.  It was my introduction to Reddit.

703,"To start a new game or move on...I’m in a serious dilemma. I’ve done about as much as I want to in post game, and I’m really hankering to start another save file and replay since I didn’t buy the Royal Pack until *after* completing the main game. HOWEVER, as much as I absolutely LOVE this game, I’m so worried that I’ll get bored halfway through another play since I’ve just logged 150+ hours. I know I won’t get bored of the main story, I’m just thinking about side quests, hunts, etc.

So, I’m debating maybe putting FFXV down and returning to where I left off in my replays of all the Kingdom Hearts games before the DLC for KH3 releases. I’m figuring if I play something else for a while then return to XV later I’ll enjoy it more. But how can I play anything else when I know it won’t be as good as XV??

I want to start a new save file...badly. I really want to play through the main story again and see if I notice things I missed on my first play through, and get to all the new royal pack stuff in chapter 14. Plus I really miss my chocobros. I just don’t know right now if it’s worth risking me getting kind of bored and not finishing it through to the end (I hate starting a game and not finishing it, hence why I’m not just switching back and forth between XV and KH.

705,"a theory on what happend with XV's story cutsso first of all i love FFXV, along with VII, its probably my favorite game of all time, this is not bashing on XV!

people say its unfinished, i never felt that.. for me it felt more like it was being mysterious and like the story we got in the game was part of a bigger story that we were not supposed to know.. its unconventional but it worked for me, i think it actually added to my enjoyment of the game

But logically it is quite obvious that there is something missing, i have suspected that one big story line was cut for some reason and they didn't have time to replace it and that's why the game is clunky at parts.

and i think i have figured out what that was -the Moon-

we all know that the instead of just nights getting longer and longer throughout the story the moon would also get bigger and we have seen those nice shots from old trailers where the moon is real big and the sky glows red, and it looks so cool, i always wondered why it was changed..i think i have figured it out also :P

you know how Tabata said that the game was pretty much done in interviews from early 16' ? and then the reason it got delayed was because they couldn't get certain parts to run on the ps4 without it crashing? most notably the leviathan fight.... i think the Moon mechanic was one of the things that would crash the game, so it had to be cut for that reason... i have read in datamined text that the moon would play a part in the story, namely the moon was gonna charge the ring! not the crystal..the big red scary moon was gonna charge the ring! Noct was gonna be imprisoned on Anglagard for 10 years while the moon got absorbed, for 2 whole chapters he was gonna be on Anglagard.

this is what the chapter description said:chapter 13, Angelgard: after he thought his body had been melted in to the crystal, noct find himself alone, locked up in an unknown space/room, surrounding him are the ""phantom swords"" he has collected so far, he can't feel the presence of the daemons. he doesn't know what happend to the imperial capital he had just been in, or what happend to his friends, he's going mad with impatiens/ restlessness.

and chapter 14: still on angelgard, the island is protected by the ""power of the star"" so powerful that the daemons and Ardyn can't get there, noct absorbs the last rays of the moon in to the ring and hopes the world and his friends are safe, when the moon is almost gone he hears a voice ""the time has come"" and the door appears. when noct has fully absorbed the power of the star and can leave the prison ,10 years has passed.

(i think what is chapter 13 now would have been chapter 12 btw)

i think this is really interesting especially considering that other than chapter 13-14 (when Noctis is imprisoned) everything plays ut pretty much the same... i have heard before that there had to be story changes after production on Kingsglaive was complete and that's why there are inconsistencies..i think all of that was tied to the moon, and the crystal was obviously supposed to be a dark crystal, and the Lucis magic was obviously supposed to be dark magic, but when they couldn't make the moon thing work, they changed the crystal to a crystal of light and don't really talk much about it....

so thats my hot take.. FFXV being weird is not because of censoring, or crappy directors(they both did good) its because of over ambitious mechanics that did not run properly!

let's hope they recycle some of it for FFXVI

cheers!

706,"Nyx Ulric's Name - Romanization ConsiderationForgive if this has been brought up before, but the romanization on Nyx's name has been on my mind a lot since I first saw it written in Japanese. It's my second language and one of my obsessions. 

It's  ニックス・ウリック in Japanese (something like ""nikkusu urikku""). In the Kingslaive movie in English, they definitely pronounce it ""Ulric"" with that ""L"" in there, so it's what the team decided was the way to say it. BUT, reading the katakana out in Japanese, that ""L"" sound added in the English reading isn't really there.  

I think the original intent was to connect Nyx to [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk), the famous walled city from the Epic of [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh). The wall is a Big Deal in Gilgamesh, and also in Kingslaive. Add that to the name pronunciation in Japanese and it's at least food for thought. What say you?",1

710,"Can a not-so-skilled player progress through Comrades?I’m in post game and already played all four episodes. I would love to play Comrades just to get some backstory as to what happened during you-know-what, but I’m worried about completing quests and progressing through the game’s story.

I’m not exactly *good* at battling, basically can’t dodge or parry very well so I always take a lot of damage in every fight. Hence why I played the main game on easy difficulty most of the time. So I’m worried about actually being able to progress in the game as I’ve heard the quests and bosses are quite difficult and require a lot of grinding and help from other players (apparently the AI’s aren’t very helpful?).

I’ve heard that most of the servers are dead. I don’t particularly like playing games with other people anyway since I’m not very good at any kind of battling and end up slowing people down and getting beat on for it (plus I’m a girl so that never goes over great on online servers). Even though I’m not a skilled player, I still play because I love games and their stories and characters, so I really want to play Comrades to fill in the story gap.

725,"On Farming the Magitek Suit V2'sI am posting this since after doing quite a lot of searching I couldn't find too many posts on that, especially trustworthy ones.

While using this step sequence, I managed to farm 12 of them in roughly one day:

TIME: Post game. 

Although MA-X Angelus-0's start spawning as soon as Chapter 3(yes, I encountered one myself through spending hours doing hunts, sidequests and reaching lvl99), you cannot start farming the V2 until you receive the Ring of Lucis in Chapter 13. You can start farming it a bit earlier as soon as you can call Umbra again, but it's better to finish the story because then you have longer days, that makes it easier for you to notice...stuff.

OPERATING SYSTEM: Playstation 4 Pro

METHOD: Alterna(Ring of the Lucii). 

Fastest way to farm the accessories by all means. However you want to actually KILL MA-X Angelus-0 is entirely up to you.

PLACE: Water tower near the Cotisse Haven, North of Hammerhead. 

Probably any place that has a nearby haven and spawns MA-X Angelus-0 works, but that's the one I was using.

KEY EQUIPMENT: Ring of Lucis, Key of Prosperity.

Most important equipment besides the Ring of Lucis is the Key of Prosperity accessory which I think you can only receive through the Holiday Pack+ add-on/dlc. I strongly believe the item drop success rate also adds to the rare item drop success rate as well.

DISH: Papa bird &amp; baby bowl.

This dish doubles your item drop success rate. As I said above, I strongly believe the item drop success rate involves the rare item chances as well. If it wasn't, I really wouldn't have collected 12 V2s in 10-12 total game hours. Anyway, although I'm not sure how much % the Key of prosperity actually adds to the already default 5% rare item drop (info from FANDOM) but I think it's something 1%-5% with 5% being unlikely but possible, the success rate doubled from the food buff would be at least 10%+KoP% or even 10%+KoP%*2 if the food buff doubles the total rate which could possibly go up to a total 20%.

SPAWNING MA-X ANGELUS-0:

1. Camp and the haven and select Papa bird &amp; baby bowl.
2. Head to the water tower.
3. Clear the area of Sabertusks.
4. Wait for the Imperial ship to come. Should be in mere seconds after you clear the area. 
5. Check. If it is Ma-X Angelus-0 - kill it and save asap. If it's not Ma-X Angelus-0 - save before the fight starts. 
6. In both occasions from step 4 - load the same file right after you save it. You can use either your main game file or create a new one.

Repeat steps 3-6 untill midnight comes (exactly 0000 or 2400) because that's when the ships stop coming and daemons start spawning in your area. Only ship that now comes is Aranea's. Then you can just use the map option to return to last place rested and rest until morning, then head beck to the tower and continue. Check your food buff also. If it's about to finish, then repeat steps 1-6.

Happy farming!

OTHER INFORMATION:

Although I didn't go into depth with this one, but probably you should make your group as tanky as possible, since Alterna's success rate is not 100% and I sincerely doubt the Magic stat has any infuence on that. During my encounters it was 50/50 that I could kill MA-X Angelus-0 in one try. If it does not work the 1st time then you will have to use it 2, 3 or even sometimes more than 10 times before it finally dies. So, the more alive members in your group, the more chance Noctis won't be targeted. And it is advisable to tank up Noctis as well so you wouldn't fall to Danger state too often.

Since you cannot influence the loading screen, the only two things that you actually can influence is how fast you will notice what's in the ship, save and load, and how fast you can take out the Final Fantasy's own freakin' Megatron(it makes that sound similar to transformers):

You can stock up on Ethers for just 100 gil each from:

Shop: House of Hexes, JM Market - Altissia, Cartanica, Tenebrae, Zegnautus Keep, Hammerhead [Ch.14], Kingsglaive Base Camp, Regalia Shop (Copied from FANDOM)

I suggest using Ethers since by the time you start farming V2's you will have accumulated a considerable amount of gil, so spending 10-20k will save you from looking for the right camera angle or even running around looking for a warp spot that you can't even see because of Alterna's visual effects.

It's best to stay near or even under MA-X Angelus-0 to avoid it firing it's rocket launcher that's impossible to ******* dodge. 

AND it's best to cast Alterna in mid-air to avoid the left arm's aoe ground attack. Although it still leaves you open for both arms' physical attack a moment before their weapons are used. Watch out for that too.

Also, it gets harder to notice what's in the ship once evening comes, so you might want to consider returning to rest point earlier before it becomes completely dark. Unless, of course, it doesn't bother you and you don't give a **** about your health.

IMPORTANT!!!

There have been some discussions on MA-X Angelus-0 RNG's spawn predictions, so here's my 2 cents:

Loading the same game file doesn't reset the RNG - saving does. Once you overwrite the file it resets the RNG and once you load it again, there are 3 spawning possibilities - 10 Magitek Assassins, MA Veles-bis with a few troops, and MA-X Angelus-0. So basically that makes it roughly a 33% chance that Angelus will spawn and that is why some people claim that they spawned one after another. My best run was 4 in a row and 1 after that. I actually managed to get 2 V2s during that run. So it's actually safe to assume that waiting for Angelus to spawn without using the save/load method will take you a lot longer.

Also! While using the method in this post at some  point I stopped spawning Angelus and got more random encounters such as Bannermen instead. It didn't feel like I did something completely out of the ordinary, but something still went wrong. Since it happen only once, I cannot tell much more because I solved it pretty fast by just killing the troops with Fire all of them at once and just saved/loaded - same just like having Angelus spawned. After that it was fixed and I stopped farming once I got my 12th Magitek Suit V2.

LASTLY! Although being a really good method to acquire V2's, it is still quite a long and demanding challenge to farm them. I would suggest taking short breaks while the game is loading like drinking some water, eating a cookie, reading an article, simply checking up something or doing small chores. That way the process won't be as monotonous and it will prevent you from getting too tired or simply falling to a psychological state that makes you completely lose your fun with the game.


WELL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THAT. Feel free to comment your thoughts. Hopefully people will try this method and also on different platforms. Please comment feedback here. I apologise in advance if smething similar was covered in the past. GOOD LUCK!",1

731,"Some thoughts on FFXVSo as the game is nearing its 3rd anniversary, I've realized how much I miss the game being ""alive"" and evolving. This game and its characters have been a real part of my life from when it was announced all the way to when Ep. Ardyn got released! It's been a wonderful journey of ups and downs, excitement and disappointment. The game will forever stay in my heart, but still, I wish I had never read all the leaks and datamines that may have soured the game for me a little bit.

Long live Final Fantasy XV and its community :)",1
732,"Just finished playing through the royal version for the first time and I loved itGod those extra bosses at the end were so fun. Cerberus was a cool fight but I loved how it makes you play as each of the characters for the 3 bosses after ifrit. And then that final attack where you had the button commands for each of them to do an attack was great. But fuck the ending still hurts like a bitch though

I had to uninstall some of his other games because there wasn't enough room to update but I updated FFXV. The only thing is I'm not seeing anything that's letting me know I'm playing the royal version. Is there an easy way to tell? For instance, in the PS store, I can still purchase all the stuff that comes with the royal edition. 

I just don't want to start a game and then have to start over because it didn't register my royal edition.

Do I have to completely uninstall FFXV and then reinstall it with my royal edition disc?

I’ve completed the game now and Episode Ardyn (which I thought would answer this), but NOWHERE do they explain who Izunia is. At the end of Chapter 13 when Noctis is getting pulled into the crystal and Ardyn is dropping some truth bombs, he specifically says “Ardyn Lucis Caelum is my proper name. You’ll never guess whose name Izunia was.” So....who tf was Izunia?? I thought it was maybe someone in Ardyn’s life that betrayed him, or someone he loved...but no.

1) is there a definite place to buy it? Which platform should I go for? If they're all the same, I'd definitely prefer to have it on Steam.

2) when I beat it, episode Ardyn wasn't out. When is the best time to play episode Ardyn? I know the optimal times to play the other 3 episodes but episode Ardyn is lost on me.

It’s not that fps goes down according to the readings it just freezes and then it’s smooth again for maybe a second then freezes again. All the time during the fight and it’s getting me killed. Any ideas on what I can do to solve this?

CPU: Intel Core i9 9900k

GPU: EVGA RTX 2070 Super XC Ultra

RAM: 32gb Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200 CL16

SSD: Samsung 860 EVO 2tb

I've heard many, and often very different opinions on how well the game will run on the 2070 Super, and I would just like some clarity. What should I enable/disable? Should I use Nvidia Hairworks, etc? I just need some general advice on what settings will make the game run at 60fps with a 1440p resolution. 

On a more specific note, I've heard that the new RTX features (Ray Tracing, DLSS) can potentially give performance a boost, but said features are only available at 4K, so... Which would give me higher fps? Using 1440p without RTX features, or using DSR to upscale to ""4K"" and then enabling RTX features? Keep in mind that my monitor (Aorus AD27QD) is 1440p, not 4K.",1

759,"PC version: Xbox interaction and DLSSThis is both for the sake of providing information where it is apparently lacking, and to request confirmation in order to address an issue that is apparently unanswered.

**Microsoft Store &amp; Xbox One**

If you are of the extreme minority who own the game on Xbox One and buy an additional copy for PC on the Microsoft Store, you will find that game saves are shared between the two. Of more interesting benefit is that you can share saves regardless of what DLC you have purchased on Xbox One; despite the PC version coming with all DLC sans Episode Ardyn, progress on the PC version's DLC is gracefully and seamlessly ignored on this save data if you skip back to playing on Xbone without having purchased the requisite DLC. This is very good to know for the extreme minority of people like me who keep multiple versions of the game (personally, PS4 Pro at 1.00/no DLC for best day one experience, Xbox One X with all DLC except Royal for best vanilla experience, PC with ALL the things) and take issue with the horrible state of the Steam version.

**PC in General**

I've only found one person asking this question across all of the internet: is DLSS only available on Steam? I own the game on Steam, and can access DLSS there. I also own the game via the Microsoft Store, and DLSS is ***not*** available there. I refuse to give EA any money whatsoever to test the Origin version, but if anyone of said version can confirm or deny DLSS being available at 3840x2160, it would be greatly appreciated.",1

For example, did you know that there's a weapon in an Imperial base that allows Noctis to shoot like it's a third-person shooter? It's just a sniper rifle, but it's there and you can use it, and I found it just recently, I've been playing since launch.

What are other secret or weird facts about FFXV?

771,"Question about Armiger WarpstrikeFrom all my time in the game, i've noticed Armiger Warpstrike is 100% legit trash.

It takes pretty long. But the damage is absolutely pathetic. Meanwhile just ""holding O"" in Armiger will do WAY and i mean WAY more damage and it will also gapclose way faster. There is no reason to use Armiger Warpstrike over ""holding O"" while in Armiger mode as far as i know.

This seems to be because Armiger Warpstrike is always only a 1.0x damage multiplier.

However… In the clip i posted below. For some reason. I suddenly get a proper Warpstrike 2.4x Multiplier while in Armiger. And my target actually dies in one hit... The Second target gets the typical 1.0x and doesn't die in one hit... again proving how bad Armiger Warpstrike really is.

In the second clip, i'm pretty far away from the target yet only get a 1.0x multiplier.

I feel like Armiger Warpstrike would actually be useful and damaging if it would get the proper multiplier based on distance. But it doesn't… So it sux.

But my question is. Why am i actually getting a multiplier in that first clip? What's the trick? What am i missing? 

https://plays.tv/video/5db8a4d61a3b5d7918

PS: if you don't believe Armiger Warpstrike is trash, notice in the second clip i only shave off 10% of a trooper's HP but then i hold O for like half a second and already do 40% HP on another target... But if it would properly get a multiplier i think it would be pretty good as shown in the first clip.",1

778,"Prompto's Best Handgun?I know this hasn't been too much of a debate singe the FFXIV event dropped, giving us the new handgun, Abandon of the Vortex, and it's good and all, but I think his best handgun is really debatable. Between Abandon of the Vortex and Death Penalty, the power difference, including strength bonus, is 6 towards Abandon of the Vortex, a very small number. It gets an increased appendage breaking advantage, which is a small niche. Otherwise, the +50% vulnerable damage is nice, but given the AI of this game, I find it won't be too useful too often. On the other hand, Death Penalty has a 1% chance to inflict Instant Death, which certainly is a small chance. But for similar damage when given the Critical Hit food (sushi), I think that Death Penalty is likely easily far better when against enemies that are susceptible to Instant Death. But when not susceptible, or when not using the Critical Hit food (sushi), it goes back to Abandon of the Vortex. 

I know this is a very small, niche topic to discuss when it's for the Handgun, used by a character that, when you control, isn't going to be using the Handgun much at all, but since I've seen people claim that Abandon of the Vortex is Prompto's best Handgun, I just thought I'd give my input.

828,"Observations from a new playerHi All,

Just wanted to share my observations from a person who has never played any FF games or even been exposed to it.  I am considered at least middle age and I have never enjoyed single player RPG's before, tried many including fallout etc.

I have to say, this one is different.  I have owned it since release, played it maybe 10 minutes on release and just shelved it (windows version)  I have been playing it the last few days and it's really been a joy.

1. The scale and scope of the detailed world is astonishing.  I am a software developer and have been over 30 years.  The level of work in this thing is just amazing to me. 

2. The interactions and story and work among the group is fun and doesn't get old or tired.  So many RPG's and JRPG's that I have tried are repetitive and annoying.  They mix it up well and make it fun and you end up caring about the story and the characters in your group and frankly I have a terrible imagination and still loved it.

3. The depth of the game, I am on chapter 3 but I have gone back to 1 and 2 areas and had fun and am level 21 already because I wanted to do more there with customizing the car and other things.

Just a really fun experience for a guy that has not had much enjoyment with single player RPG's in the past.  I'd highly recommend more than a cursory glance if you are like me and just never really liked them.

Take care!",1

I am actually typing this while I wait for Windows 10 to finish installing onto my USB pen drive to fully format my PC.  
I have constant grey screen crashes, black screen crashes, and just out of the blue normal crash to desktop crashes.

For crying out loud, I'm having crashes every 2 minutes of starting a load...   
I've tried DDUing my GPU drivers (in safe mode ofc.); reinstalling the GPU drivers; turning off Ansel - I literally deleted the gods damned folder from the drive to be sure -; forced windows to update (I always set it up to only download updated after the maximum amount of time, like 6 months or something; Tried borderless window, fullscreen, even windowed mode  both on the .ini file and ingame; max settings and low settings; all nvidia shit on AND off; V sync on and off...

I give up. No other game has been this frustrating to me. The annoying part is that I was actually having fun - But for some reason ever since I reached Zegnautus this has become unbearable...

I was mixed on this game to begin with, got to Chapter 13 and feel like dropping the game. I'll probably push through and finish the awful main story at least though, assuming it's coming to a merciful end sometime soon.

I know he upgrades your weapons and stuff but the party has a much closer relationship with Cindy so she might as well be this game’s Cid.

I really enjoy ""near"" too because it makes the world seem bigger and makes combat even more flashy. For controls I use ""Type B"" as having attack on circle and block on x just feels wrong.

Dispute its shortcomings, it was a 10/10 experience for me at launch even if the game itself was more like a 7/10. And as the DLCs rolled out I was playing them as soon as I possible could up until the end when graduating college got in the way. 

But as of recently, I have a job and free time again, so I finally found the time to replay the story of the game again, purchasing the new content to see what was in store. I think from a monetary value standpoint, the royal pack is far and beyond a great deal. However, I feel like the new chapter 14 really distracts and detracts from the story beats the original game has. 

[spoiler content ahead I guess if you haven’t played yet but I’m guessing I’m the outlier here?]

But I feel like a lot of it felt super distracting from the ending. Like at long last after 10 years of gathering providence let me do some photo quests and hunt down some mini enemy bases. And I get they were trying to tie comrades into the main game but honestly the whole glaive thing and the Cor thing felt super weird. And the boss fights with the kings of yore are both more interesting and more difficult than the actual final boss is, which was extremely jarring for me. 

I did like all the new gameplay features and the addition of the Cerberus fight based on some of the old trailers for versus, but I feel like I kinda wish I didn’t have the royal pack DLC adoro story purposes now. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? I was really excited to play the new content, but I feel like it doesn’t fit into the game naturally. Idk. 

Speaking of weird story additions, don’t even get me started on episode ardyn, and from what I read of translation of the book thing, I’m glad the rest of DLC didn’t come into fruition.",1

904,"Which Final Fantasy XV content should be archived?Yesterday I opened a thread where I explained that I have created a fan page for Final Fantasy XV, where there are two projects for FF15. The first project was a translated version of ""Parting Ways"" in German. Shortly thereafter, I was informed that there is already an official German version. Shame about my time.

The second project is the ""Archive Project."" There are countless collateral materials to Final Fantasy XV. From anime about a movie and spin-off games. And anyone who knows Square knows that it is not certain that this content will always be available.

As an example we would have the two mobile games ""Justice Monsters Five"" and ""King's Knight"". Both can now no longer be played on mobile and the former is only available in the main game at vending machines. That's why the Archive-project was launched.

The goal is to retain as many relevant side-material as possible, to allow players to have the fullest possible experience with Final Fantasy XV.

To put it directly: The archived materials were all obtained legally and in compliance with the (German) law. We are non-commercial and have no personal benefits from this project. We do it all in our free time. We will also post our backups on our website only if certain media are no longer available on official channels (Youtube-Chanel, official websites, etc.) and / or require an absurd price to procure official copies.

As I said. Our goal is to keep future games of Final Fantasy XV open at all times to provide the most complete experience possible.

At the moment we have the following archived both digitally and physically:

&amp;#x200B;

Dawn Trailer

Omen trailer

Omen Trailer 2.0

A Walkthrough of ""A Kings Tale""

A Walkthrough of ""Platinum Demo""

A Walkthrough of ""Episode Duscae""

Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV with german and english subtitles

The German and English version of ""Parting Ways""

&amp;#x200B;

Current in Work is ""Episode Ardyn: Prologue"" with the official German Subtitles.

The lore and what makes the world so interesting is not in the game, but in movies, spin-offs, books, separate video games.. ect.. Seemed like it was two separate games held together by ducktape (Open World/Linear Pathway on rails). 

Chapter 13 especially sucked. Running down corridors and unlocking doors and turning on power for 30 minutes while Ayrden? tells you that you’re powerless while destroying deamons was the worst thing, (besides the shit boss fight with leviathan) that i’ve ever had to do in a video game on PS4. 

I also feel ripped off. I’ve watched many ’trailers’ for the game before playing it and next to none of it is in the actual game (except combat mechanics and the Gods).. entire sequences were scrapped/removed). None of the pre-rendered ‘movie cutscences had any volume at all. The story was awful. The ’skills’ were irrelevent. 

Literally the only cool thing were the Gods and riding Chocobos. 

the sidequests and hunts were terrible. The ‘love interest’ with Luna’s death was the most unearned emotion in a final fantasy game. Alot of the English Dub was just terrible and awkward.

I think I'll be able to level up a bit, picked up the Menace Beneath Lucis questline, but I'm kinda lost as to how I can get to Rank 10 Hunter. There is literally no hunt left, I've double checked the tipsters and everything is completed. I went back to Altissia to check the tipster at the Cafe, nothing either. I could really use some help here, how did you guys get Rank 10???
Also what are some tips to level up faster? I prep the mega sandwich meal everytime I camp, and I use the moogle charm too. Anything else I should know about?",1

I waltzed in with proper protection and got to business. Problem was I found myself taking lots, lots of damage and I was like wth...so I just kept fighting and chugging potions like an addict and THEN I saw what was hurting me so badly. A whole fleet of Magitek Assassins was beating my ass since they were lv 47, I counted 8 of them....oh god but I was trying my best to fight them and those wasps. I managed to defeat the Assassins yay but another fleet of Assassins came in. Running low on potions I managed to summon Ramuh! He grabbed me and obliterated them instantly! Finally after 20 minutes of fighting the hunt was completed! But this was not the time to celebrate just yet, more Assassins showed up and I got out of there! Is that particular place a infinite spawn point for Assassins or something?",1

920,"Apocalypsis Noctis/Aquarius Updated English TranslationThe only online English translation of the lyrics to this song is a reddit post from a year or so back, and the translation is, to put it nicely, not entirely accurate. Please don't take this as me dumping on OP! Latin is a really difficult language even when written correctly, which the lyrics to this song definitely are not. But it's been bugging me for over a year now, so I finally decided to sit down and put my Latin degree to use.


&amp;nbsp;


This probably isn't 100% accurate either - like I said, the original Latin is dodgy, so there was a lot of having to guess what the author might have *intended* to write rather than translating the grammatical nonsense that they actually wrote. But this is definitely a lot more accurate than the previous translation.


&amp;nbsp;


With your face toward me

all so greatly worship my flesh.

&amp;nbsp;


I am the one who throws stones

and steers all lives.

&amp;nbsp;


Heaven, Earth, turned away

And the great, the small, returned


&amp;nbsp;


As a mighty leader, I command

the light that you will bind with your voice.


&amp;nbsp;


When all is full of light

there will come the end of the Apocalypse.


&amp;nbsp;


Conquered will be the one that devoured

the lives of all here: the darkness.


&amp;nbsp;


Evil incarnate rises,

bringing with it death.

Prepare! Prepare! Prepare! Prepare!


&amp;nbsp;


The mighty king, warrior,

sword in hand.

A war in virtue

won over the enemy.


&amp;nbsp;


First comes death

which comes for a certain person.

All prepare! All prepare! All prepare!


&amp;nbsp;


This is the time,

this is the place

where we must make our stand,

all of us at last, every last one of us!


&amp;nbsp;


All of us!",1

I know there is so much dialogue in this game, but I was hoping one of you would be able to help me find a particular line (mainly because I want to prove to myself that I'm not crazy/didn't imagine it), but I very distinctly remember seeing both in game and seeing it posted online where there's one line in the game from Ignis that isn't in his normal accent. It sounds just a wee bit off, like his original English VA's accent, but seemingly wasn't re-recorded with the proper accent. I think it was a post-battle dialogue or idle dialogue from Altissia, but I'm at a loss and can't find it no matter what I Google. I haven't been able to trigger it in game, either.

Was it patched out? Does anyone know what I'm talking about? And if you find a video of it, I would be forever grateful if you could link it to me - thanks!

Edit: Okay, I'm 95% sure the line is ""Didja ya see that, Noct?"" I can hear it in my head, but can't find a video/audio clip of it. If you find it, PLEASE link here - thanks!

Second edit: I found it! Starting clicking random videos in Altissia, but so you know I'm not crazy, here's the line: [https://youtu.be/p-2JOzjKSR8?t=1370](https://youtu.be/p-2JOzjKSR8?t=1370)

I didn't know what that was so after I read what it does and tested it I really liked it (mostly because of the AoE damage it did and it looked pretty cool). But when I thought about farming for the item that gave me that ability I completely forgot what the name of it was. I was wondering if there are any more items like the one I used that could give the same type of abilities like that one had (i.e. ice, fire, lighting, etc.). If you know which missions I can farm for items like that the please tell me below.

What I really would have loved in the full game would be thr weapon skills you activate with the triangle button. Thats was certainly cool!

968,"Maybe someone will save their money... don't buy this game on Steam - it's inferior performance is not worth your money.FFXV Windows Edition is the best version of FFXV to date, mainly because of this sweet, buttery-smooth framerates that you can get... on every store version except Steam. Due to the poor implementation of SteamAPI this version has the worst performance of all, getting stutters and framerate dips out of nowhere. Take a look at this:

Steam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6mBmdQMM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6mBmdQMM8)

Origin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJl7Zql5oE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJl7Zql5oE)

Steam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvvjMqwF2gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvvjMqwF2gw)

Microsoft Store: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wmOXWYP\_IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wmOXWYP_IQ)

I can confirm that this is a thing. There is one workaround, you can downgrade game manually to version 1.25 (the last stable Steam release), but doing that also disables some of additional content, including Episode Ardyn compatibility. Sure, you can blaze through the base game and three episodes on 1.25 and then update your game to play Ardyn, but... why bother if you have possibility to buy the game on other store and have zero problems with it? After playing FFXV on PS4 at launch I was eager to replay it on PC, bought the Steam version only to discover that it's stuttery mess. Bought again yesterday on Origin and man... the difference is real.
