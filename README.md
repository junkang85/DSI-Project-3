Executive Summary and Problem Statment
1. As the gaming population is getting younger, there is a need to explore the concept of gathering sentiments from the gamming community through social media for product analysis and development
2. For proof of concept, prototype production classification models are built to classify posts from 2 different Sub-Reddits (FFVII Remake and FFXV)
3. Gain insights on the gaming product through the data science modeling process

Sub-Reddits
1. FFVII Remake: 'https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake.json'
2. FFXV: 'https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV.json'

Models
1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Voting Classifier (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)

Inference and Conclusion
1. High FFVII Remake Sub-Reddit post counts at product pre-launch suggest that the FF community is comfortable with social media as compared to in 2016
2. Data science prototype production models achieved good classification performance results, able to get a high-level sensing on the sentiments of the community
3. Data mining and modeling of social media data able to assist in FF product analysis and future development
