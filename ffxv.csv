* **What is Final Fantasy XV?**

Final Fantasy XV (Japanese: ファイナルファンタジーXV; Simplified Chinese: 最终幻想15; Traditional Chinese: 最終幻想XV; stylized FINAL FANTASY XV; Final Fantasy 15 in some regions; abbreviated FFXV and FF15), the fifteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, follows Prince Noctis of Lucis and his three friends who must save the world of Eos by defeating the Niflheim Empire and purging darkness the plagues the ""star"" (another name for world).

Due to the scale of the game's narrative, the Final Fantasy XV project was split into several multi-media parts, dubbed the Final Fantasy XV Universe, to increase awareness of the game to different audiences.

* **Should I play Final Fantasy XV?**

The answer to this question is ultimately up to you. What some consider “good” might be others’ “bad,” and vice versa.

The game’s strengths lie in:

* the layered characterization.
* the themes of friendship, brotherhood, and accepting your duty with grace.
* the attention to “little things.”
* the freedom of choice in combat and exploration.
* the graphics.

However, some criticism includes:

* the implicit storytelling and unexplained events.
* the amount of research required to completely understand the story.
* the simplistic depictions of war, politics, and revenge.
* the linear final third of the game.
* the lack of forced difficulty.

We strongly recommend you form your own opinion!

* **What are all the pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The confirmed pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe are the works in the following table.

* **Do I need to play the DLCs, experience all of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, or play other Final Fantasy games?**

The DLCs and the Final Fantasy XV Universe is entirely optional. According to Tabata, their purpose is for a player to “get a better view of the world where the game is set.”  While each part of the Final Fantasy XV Universe is optional, “some fans who only see one part might be left with a negative impression, or like they've missed crucial parts of the tale.” You can play Final Fantasy XV without playing the DLCs or experiencing the Final Fantasy XV Universe, but you will need to pay more attention to context clues.

You do not need to play other Final Fantasy games in order to understand Final Fantasy XV. Each “numbered” Final Fantasy does not share a storyline with another. At most, playing other Final Fantasy games allow you to notice references and recurring themes.

* **What is the best order to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The crucial pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, besides the main game itself, and other pieces are listed below. They are listed in the order in which they were released and include the approximate time they take place in the “timeline” (see “Which parts are ‘canon’?”). Use this information to determine when is the best time to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe and related media.

1. Platinum Demo — 12 year before the beginning of the game.
2. Brotherhood — 15, 12, 8, and 5 years before the start of the game, and Chapters 1 through 3.
3. Kingsglaive — less than a year before the start of the game to the start of the game.
4. Prologue ~Parting Ways~ — the day before the start of the game.
5. Episode Gladiolus — during Chapter 7.
6. Episode Prompto — during Chapters 12 and 13.
7. Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades — between Chapters 13 and 14 and, for Future quests, Chapter 14.
8. Episode Ignis — during Chapters 9, 13, 14, and the end of the game.
9. Royal Pack — adds content throughout the entire game.
10. Episode Ardyn -Prologue- — &gt;!2,000!&lt; years before the beginning of the game and Chapter 14.
11. Episode Ardyn — &gt;!2,000!&lt;, &gt;!35!&lt;, and &gt;!22!&lt; years before and Chapter 14.

* **What are the upcoming DLC and updates for Final Fantasy XV?**

Development for Final Fantasy XV ended on March 25, 2019, with the release of Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn. The other three planned Dawn of the Future DLC—Episode Aranea, Episode Lunafreya, and Episode Noctis—have been canceled. However, a novelization of the Dawn of the Future DLC was released in Japan on April 25, 2019, and an English version will be coming *no earlier* than Fall 2019.

There are no updates planned for the main game or Final Fantasy XV Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades because development has been ceased. However, there may still be small updates to the executable files. (This is not the same as a bug fix.)

* **What's up with the different versions of Comrades? Can I still get the Comrades DLC version trophies?**

Initially, Comrades was released as a DLC expansion launched through Final Fantasy XV called Multiplayer Expansion: Comrades. As of patch 1.27, the DLC expansion was moved to a standalone launcher on consoles called Multiplayer: Comrades. The PC version is the only platform that does not have a standalone launcher for Comrades.

After patch 1.27 on consoles, the DLC expansion's trophies are no longer obtainable. Furthermore, any trophies earned and any saves created on the DLC expansion will be transferred to the standalone version, although trophies may not activate until you unlock certain parts of the game. Finally, players can still access the DLC version to view previous photos and create characters for the &gt;!Chapter 14 cameo!&lt;; you cannot play missions on the DLC version.

* **Which version of Final Fantasy XV should I buy?**

Final Fantasy XV was released in many different editions. Please use [this table in our Wiki to view the differences between each edition’s content](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/console#wiki_difference_between_editions).

As a rule of thumb:

* If you do not have a copy of Final Fantasy XV, you should buy the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition for the PS4 or XB1 and the Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition for PC. These editions are a bundle of all of the 2016 to 2018 content; the 2019 content (Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn) has not been released as a cost-effective bundle.
* If you do have a copy of Final Fantasy XV for PS4 or XB1, wish to keep playing on PS4 or XB1, do not want the “bonus items”, and the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition is not on sale, it’s more cost-effective to buy the DLC individually.
* If you are considering whether to buy the Windows Edition, keep in mind that it is meant for high-end computers. Use the demo and benchmark tool to determine whether your system will run Final Fantasy XV to your satisfaction. Beware of late-game spoilers in the trailer at the end of the demo!
* Consider buying the game on sale. The base game and its bundles are often on sale for around 50% off.
* If you are buying a *used copy* Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition, make sure it comes with working codes. The DLC is not included on the disc.
* On console, the DLC region needs to match the base game region.

* **My game’s not working! How do I fix it?**

Please attempt some troubleshooting yourself by following [our Technical Support guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/tech_support) for consoles and PC before making a help post. If you're making a help post, be as specific as possible with your problem and attempts to fix it.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development for Final Fantasy XV ended on March 25, 2019, with the release of Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn. The other three planned Dawn of the Future DLC—Episode Aranea, Episode Lunafreya, and Episode Noctis—have been canceled. However, a novelization of the Dawn of the Future DLC was released in Japan on April 25, 2019, and an English version will be coming &lt;em&gt;no earlier&lt;/em&gt; than Fall 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s up with the different versions of Comrades? Can I still get the Comrades DLC version trophies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Comrades was released as a DLC expansion launched through Final Fantasy XV called Multiplayer Expansion: Comrades. As of patch 1.27, the DLC expansion was moved to a standalone launcher on consoles called Multiplayer: Comrades. The PC version is the only platform that does not have a standalone launcher for Comrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After patch 1.27 on consoles, the DLC expansion&amp;#39;s trophies are no longer obtainable. Furthermore, any trophies earned and any saves created on the DLC expansion will be transferred to the standalone version, although trophies may not activate until you unlock certain parts of the game. Finally, players can still access the DLC version to view previous photos and create characters for the &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Chapter 14 cameo&lt;/span&gt;; you cannot play missions on the DLC version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which version of Final Fantasy XV should I buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy XV was released in many different editions. Please use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/console#wiki_difference_between_editions""&gt;this table in our Wiki to view the differences between each edition’s content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do not have a copy of Final Fantasy XV, you should buy the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition for the PS4 or XB1 and the Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition for PC. These editions are a bundle of all of the 2016 to 2018 content; the 2019 content (Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn) has not been released as a cost-effective bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do have a copy of Final Fantasy XV for PS4 or XB1, wish to keep playing on PS4 or XB1, do not want the “bonus items”, and the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition is not on sale, it’s more cost-effective to buy the DLC individually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are considering whether to buy the Windows Edition, keep in mind that it is meant for high-end computers. Use the demo and benchmark tool to determine whether your system will run Final Fantasy XV to your satisfaction. Beware of late-game spoilers in the trailer at the end of the demo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider buying the game on sale. The base game and its bundles are often on sale for around 50% off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are buying a &lt;em&gt;used copy&lt;/em&gt; Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition, make sure it comes with working codes. The DLC is not included on the disc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On console, the DLC region needs to match the base game region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My game’s not working! How do I fix it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please attempt some troubleshooting yourself by following &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/tech_support""&gt;our Technical Support guide&lt;/a&gt; for consoles and PC before making a help post. If you&amp;#39;re making a help post, be as specific as possible with your problem and attempts to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

9,,FFXV,"Hello,

I am currently trying to obtain my last trophy ""Kenny come back"" on the steam version of the game. I've been playing comrades for longuer than I care to admit and it still never spawned. I was wondering if anyone know if we are still able to do daily quest online with other players in this version. I saw online that there is a way to nearly garantee Kenny's spawn if done this way.

If so, I'd like to know if anyone wants to join with me?

Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

I have, via contact with some Final Fantasy Distant Worlds folk, obtained the choral score to ""APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS"", and importantly, the lyrics. While they are in Latin, are really interesting, and written one who has studied ancient Roman culture and language. There is A LOT of specific religious imagery and allusions. At this time, I cannot provide a smooth translation (I should actually be studying for the Latin exam I have coming up...), but I will soon! And in the meantime, I'll post the lyrics, and my thoughts on what I gathered from site reading them.

&amp;#x200B;

**-During the Intro-**

Specie tua, tantum carnem adme omnes habet cultum

Ego sum qui mittit petras et gubernat omnes vitae.

Coelum\*, Terra, aversione. Magna, parvus, reversusque.

Fortis ductor, praecipio Quod ligabis lucem vobis.

**-Verse, after string melody-**

Cum omnibus lucis plenus, Apocalypse finibus

Victum unus qui comedit, Hic vitae omnia; tenebris

**-During oboe solo, choir is quiet-**

Malum incarnatus surgit, Adducentes secum mortem.

Para! Para! PARA! PARA!

**-After the Key Change, the women and men sing this next part in stretto (offset from each other)-**

Fortis Rex, Bellator, in manus gladio Bellum in virtute,

Victum quod hostibus. Para!

**-After the strings' and piano descending scale in octaves | More stretto between the women and men-**

Magis mortem venit primum. Quod est quidam venire.

Para omnes! Para omnes! Para omnes! *(the women sing ""Para omnes"" on offbeats while the men sing ""Para"" thrice across the whole stanza)*

**-Final stanza, the Big Finale-**

Nunc est tempus, Haec est locus Ubi nos obstandum, omne tandem ex nobis.

Unum! Omnes!

***-BIG G IN THE LOW BRASS AND STRINGS-***

\*Coelum is an alternate spelling of Caelum, which means sky/heaven. In Medieval Latin (which again, this is), that's the common spelling. It also helps to avoid confusing it with the Caelum family. In this case, coelum is  indeed just heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, we are being told the King, the True King, is the highest of them all. Both Heaven and Earth avert (Coelum, Terra, aversione) their gazes from him. He shines plenty of light, he's got a sword, he's really powerful, nothing compares. His arrival is the end. The Astrals (my interpretation) are telling you to prepare yourself (Para!) for the coming of True King. And once you've done that, go tell everyone else to prepare (Para omnes!). I'm not saying that the True King is God, since the writers stopped short of calling him that in the lyrics, but there is certainly a fair of... comparison to be made with a certain other ""King of Kings"".

Anyways, I'll update this post with a translation as soon as I can! If anyone else wants to tackle it, please by all means! Hope y'all can find some fun things in this!

EDIT: I can't believe I didn't even translate the title. While it's probably obvious, I'll do it anyways. Says ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" or ""Noctis's Apocalypse"".

However, I just got to prompto and... am I only one who thinks this is a fun change of pace?

Like, I actually enjoyed Dirge of Cerberus. I wont deny its faults. But it was still fun. This feels like a more involved version of that.

I love the different weapons, strategies, and how he just plays. I wouldnt actually mind a whole game like this.

Plus he naturally regains health and so it's more like a third person shooter rpg. I would love to see a game where you get to steal weapons, add them to your arsenal. Gotta collect ammo, but keep it sort of scarce. Or instead of stealing the weapon a second time, if they hold the same weapon you have equipped you simply get ammo for it. The  something like resonance of fate where you can customize the guns. Rpg like. 

I feel square is sitting on something that could truly be amazing. Prompto is also the only character of the four who had a background. A past full of darkness and mystery (they failed to really explore...). And I just love the goofball.

50,,FFXV,"I didn't know whether to post here or to the KH subreddit, but I figured that this place would have more people that are aware of the development process of Versus XIII which later on turned out to be FFXV. I've been googling a lot of things and since I'm not familiar as to what happened in the long development process, I was hoping that someone could give me some answers or just correct me if (when) I get some things wrong. I'll try and make a TLDR at the bottom. 

So to summarize, the KH3 Re:Mind DLC (spoilers) had a (actually two) secret ending which basically recreated a VXIII trailers opening frames. It has Yozora (character strongly resembling Noctis) waking up in a car. There are lots of comparison videos online, if you want to check it out. But basically that and earlier references to VsXIII and FFXV have been interpreted by lots of people as a sign that Nomura is 'salty' about losing Versus XIII and that he will make it (versus) no matter what. Now I'm here not to discuss as to whether or not Nomura will try to recreate the project, but I'm here to ask why Nomura would be salty. 

I'll now write something based on things I've read and how I've experienced them. Correct me if I'm wrong during any of this. VsXIII was revealed in 2006 with a cinematic trailer and as the years progressed more and more trailers came, but no actual release dates/signs of the game being close to release. I've understood that there's been also development hell surrounding the project, with lots of troubles regarding game engines (?) etc. The game was later renamed (don't know what's the correct word here) to FFXV in 2013, and Nomura was removed (?) in 2014. Then Square said that 

&gt;This move allows Tetsuya Nomura to focus his full efforts as the director of other highly anticipated titles, including Kingdom Hearts III

So Nomura had been working on a title for 8 years, and according to Tabata the game had been 20-25% complete before it became FFXV. So clearly not nearly ready and Nomura had to move on to other projects, like KH3 which was already highly anticipated at the time. This is where my question as to why Nomura is or even would be salty? He had a lot of time to develop the game and although a lot of the roadblocks weren't created/caused by him, he had to have understood that it was time to move on. Also I feel like FFXV pretty much did justice to Versus XIII and things that Nomura had created. This is just based off of my personal gameplay experience of FFXV and watching Versus trailers but the two seem to have had a lot of similiar ideas and themes. Surely some differences (Stella vs Lunafreya, Fabula Nova Crystalis) but that would be inevitable when you consider a creative process that span upon over 10 years. But even in the very first trailer of versus there are things that carried over to FFXV. From my point of view it seems like XV respected the ideas/groundwork that Nomura had laid out for Versus. For gods sake Nomura's name is the only one that you see on the title screen. So do you think that Nomura feels like he's been unjustifiably removed from Versus XIII and that square took away his dream project?

As for another note now that I've gotten excited about the future of KH, I've stumbled into a lot lot of comment sections praising Versus and bashing XV. That just seems like the biggest circlejerk I've probably ever seen. Like how can you love a game that you never got to play, that you've mostly just seen pre-rendered gameplay and trailers. It wasn't even a complete game and nobody knew what the story would be, but I've seen people saying things like 'Stella was the perfect antagonist' and 'it was everything I liked in a video game'. Like how can someone say such things and be serious? To me it seems like VsXIII is something that a lot of people have created their own unique versions in their head, and now have collectively decided that it was an amazing game. When it really wasn't even a complete game.

But yeah I'd appreciate it if anybody wants to share their thoughts about these things with me and answer some of the things I've yet to understand. Also feel free to correct me if I stated something obviously wrong, I'm a little hazy about the facts since I'm completely new to FF as a whole. Hope that this was managable to read, since English isn't my first language.

56,,FFXV,"that maybe Versus 13 was initially intended to be Versus Kingdom Hearts... people seem to think Nomura created Yozora and that whole thing out of pettiness for having lost FFXV and Noctis, but i think this was his plan all along..but for Noctis

the first versus trailer came out in 2006, just one year after KH2! and if i remember correctly back around that time it was being compared alot to KH, and looking back at that trailer now it does feel more like KH than FF..but with blood :P

so my theory is that Nomura wanted to use that unnamed protagonist (that later became Noctis) in his own series that would run parallel to KH and then eventually cross over in KH3.. like KH but without disney and really dark..heck, maybe OG Noctis kingdom was in the realm of darkness!

but square was going in hard with the FNC so it ended up there as versus 13, and then later became FFXV..and when he basically lost custody of Noct he couldn't/ didn't want to go through with his original idea..delaying KH3..

but now he's doing it with new characters.. im curious to see where he's going with this.. i love FFXV, its probably my favorite game of all times, but i wouldn't mind seeing Nomura's original vision come to life in the KH univers.. but then again, Yozora is cool and all but he ain't no Noct..

the more i think about this the more clues and similarities i see

a while back i made a [theory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/comments/ds2ncr/a_theory_on_what_happend_with_xvs_story_cuts/) about how i think the moon was gonna play a part in the FFXV story but was cut late in production leading to the story feeling wonky in some parts.. i was gonna make a follow up with a theory about how the moon would have played in but i never got around to it

i think the moon would have played much the same roll as Etro's gate would have in the original concept, collecting the souls of the dead, ~~it would probably also have been closely connected to Luna lol.~~ if that was the case it would make sense for Ardyn to spread the starscourge to turn people in to daemons so that our protagonists would kill them and fuel the moon, until something.

now, replace the moon with kingdom hearts, Ardyn with Xehanort, and the daemons with heartless and you basically have a twist on the KH basic concept!

at first i was like ""this is too much like KH, it can't be right, Nomura wouldn't create 2 stories that similar""but now with the Yozora stuff im starting to think there might be something to this and that he created the Versus world to be a dark parallel to KH, with a similar but darker story and without disney.

basically sora= realm of light, OG Noctis= realm of darkness, and they are connected by the realm of dreams!  back in the day Noctis whole deal was that he slept alot :P and Sora sure does alot of dreaming! nomura has said that Noct and Sora are complete opposites in many ways, but there are alot connecting the 2 of them!

nothing is either good or bad, only thinking makes it so

(edit: KH1 secret ending for those who think im completely crazy comparing versus and KH  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtXZp3B-tc&amp;ab\_channel=RajmanGamingHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtXZp3B-tc&amp;ab_channel=RajmanGamingHD) (yes i know its roxas and riku)",t2_2uefen0q,False,,0,False,"about Yozora, i'm starting to think..","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THOUGHTS + RUMORS'}]",r/FFXV,False,6,theoriesrumors,0,,False,t3_etqbhf,False,light,,public,21,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},THOUGHTS + RUMORS,False,21,,False,spoiler,1579973228.0,,[],{},self,,True,,1579984896.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.FFXV,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;that maybe Versus 13 was initially intended to be Versus Kingdom Hearts... people seem to think Nomura created Yozora and that whole thing out of pettiness for having lost FFXV and Noctis, but i think this was his plan all along..but for Noctis&lt;/p&gt;

The fight receives so much hype and build. There's a lot of tension and drama and intrigue with the Empire and Luna and Ardyn and Ravus and of course our heroes all being there.  Leviathan proves to be quite...willful and it's up to Noct to prove himself to this goddess.

The music is some of the best in the game - which is saying something.

The visuals are amazing for both phases.

Noct is overcome with a mix of anguish and fury and desperation and we can feel that, too.

I don't think any of these factors were in such perfect alignment in any other fight. It's equal parts emotional and awesome and just plain fun.

78,,FFXV,"So, as a long time JRPG fan, I've of course heard the cliche about ""of course God is evil"" or ""of course the church is evil."" FFX had an evil church and FFXIII had evil gods. I chose my thread title to specifically contrast with the song ""Fighting Fate"" in FFXIII which was used as the boss theme for our enslaved heroes defying the god who was trying to use them. Because FFXV ultimately has the total opposite message of FFXIII.

Behind all the Bromance, Final Fantasy XV is a game about duty and responsibility and, yes, fate. The fal'Cie - the gods of FFXIII - are actively malicious beings who care nothing for humans and even take some pleasure in their suffering. From the start humans were just pans to the fal'Cie. The death of all humans is the goal of the fal'Cie in the game. While the citizens of Cocoon venerate the fal'Cie it's made very clear this is just a cultivated image, a lie, and that they are in no way benevolent.

Then we come to Final Fantasy XV. It gives you the Cosmogony at the start and never wavers from that tone.The great and decidedly (morally) Good Six created humanity and the world. Everyone from every place clearly worships the gods and never once is this worship questioned, quite the opposite in fact.  In his benevolence, Bahamut blessed the Oracle so as to help humans. Continuing on in the game we see remnants of the mightiest, most advanced civilization on Eos and Shiva tells us this was a group of humans who actively worshiped and worked with Ifrit.  Only when they became ungrateful and arrogant did they lose everything. Speaking of Shiva, the Empire killing her reeks havoc on the planet. Far from just being morally good, the Six appear to wield a metaphysical influence over the world such that killing any of them is slitting your own throat by destroying the world.

And then of course there's the ending. Noctis does not just give his life for the people or to restore the light. He does it because it is his destiny, because it has been ordained by the gods. This beautiful, heroic moment is beautiful and heroic because it shows Noctis' faith in the divine and their plan. He gave himself to fate to save the world.

91,,FFXV,"I'm really not one to pour my heart out online but I thought I'd post this. Hopefully no one makes fun of me, haha.  

A year ago today I was introduced to the Final Fantasy series, for the first time, by my brother. At the time I was going through some heavy depression after several stressful events in my life. I was pretty much at my lowest point and needed something to do while I was recovering from a small injury (nothing major) and a really bad common cold. 

So my brother downloaded some games on Steam for me and we started Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition. Again, I had never played a Final Fantasy game nor any RPGs, either. I had zero expectations. I didn't know about Versus XIII or the controversy surrounding the game. I was just excited for something new to focus on.  

I could could go on about how much fun I had while playing the game but I'll keep it short and sweet. I  *loved* the music, which is what stood out to me first. Valse Di Fantastica/Sunset Waltz, Noctis and Stand By Me are songs that I still hum constantly. I really appreciated the focus on friendship/brotherhood and loved the four main characters. I grew so attached to them actually that when I was accidentally spoiled about &gt;!Noctis' fate I forced myself to believe it wouldn't happen and when it finally did, I was heartbroken but satisfied with the ending. !&lt; Noctis and Prompto are both characters who I could really relate with and the relationship between the four reminded me of what friends I do have, as well as my brother. Not only that, but the theme of living on even after the death of a loved one is something that resonated with me deeply. 

It didn't take me very long to beat the game, about three weeks of playing every day and after school, but in that time I started to feel happier and still, I find it silly that a video game is what helped me through such a slump.

Today I see a lot of people say video games are bad for you, and I think this stigma is slowly fading but as an addition FFXV didn't keep me inside, it inspired me to do the things I thought were the most fun in-game, besides, riding giant birds. 

I kept pursuing my passion for photography, I decided for the first time, ""Why not go camping?"" and ended up going and loving it. I started hiking and going fishing with my dad which he was surprised by. I got into Florence + The Machine and after a year of an art block, I started drawing again. 

Now, video games are just another hobby of mine like the ones above. Final Fantasy XV introduced me into the series as a whole, I ended up playing FFX last summer and I'm very excited for the FFVII remake. I also ended up playing some other RPGs, because of the amazing in-game voice actors, which I never would have thought of doing before. 

I was going through a lot of hardship last year but in short Final Fantasy is just one thing that helped me move on.

99,,FFXV,"Ten years and then four more years later... and I finally got around to playing this game.

I was originally far more excited for it than FF13 when it was announced. Waited forever. Then got worried with the reviews. To me, the Final Fantasy series is a staple in story telling. I have been let down before, but this game truly took the cake.

FF13 was too convoluted. Though I did enjoy it's two sequels. It was just a headache to follow. But I give them props for the amount of effort they DID pour into the story.FF12 was one that I just felt was empty. It had everything there, but I just couldn't find myself drawn to any of the characters or world.

&amp;#x200B;

But then comes FF15. A game with SO much potential that I feel especially empty upon reaching the ending. A road trip among four friends... how can we POSSIBLY screw up that kind of emotional payload?! The first 90% of the game does exactly that.

&amp;#x200B;

First, if I don't want to feel like a COMPLETE third (or well, fifth?) wheel; I need to watch Brotherhood. Why? Why didn't they redo these episodes in the ACTUAL game? How great it would have been to get little snippits like this. In fact, every camp spot should have had at least maybe ONE scene. SOMETHING like a flashback or a shared moment. Nothing HUGE, just... something more. They forget that we did not create these characters. We did not spend time growing up with them. We are the stranger entering a new group of friends we just made who are all like, 'remember that one time Noctis fell asleep?"" ""OH YEAH! That was SOOOO funny!"" and I am like, 'context please?'

&amp;#x200B;

We have a group of four friends. I want to know ALL about them. Everything up to this point in time. What has kept them together. What instills faith in one another? The road trip itself should have been wrought with peril and challenges. There were a few side quests that brought them together, but I felt each area should have had it's own unique NPC. At least one. That gave some sort of quest that either challenged their friendship, or highlighted it. Instead of like 5 NPC's that after you do a quest, they move to another location. More reason to explore. More reason to do side quests. Even something as simple as a little conversation as you are running to the destination of how this side quest reminds you guys of a time or connects to a part of your past.

See where I am going with this? They had so many opportunities to bring these guys together and make you FEEL for them. To UNDERSTAND them. To LOVE them. Instead, up to the end, I feel like I don't belong in this group of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads to the other problem with the narrative. The first 75% of the games story can basically be summarized with, 'Lets go get married! Oh no, my kingdom is dead! Lets find my weapons! Lets go speak to the summon dudes! Lets get back on track to getting over the sea! Oh no, Luna is dead! Oh no, we are all depressed! Oh no, Ignis is blind! Oh no, Prompto is gone!' before anything really GOOD gets going.

&amp;#x200B;

We should have started in Insomnia. Get a real idea of Noctis' life. Meet up with each friend. Get to understand a little bit of the role they play. Learn a bunch of lore about the city, about these characters, about who YOU are. Then, get summoned to go on a road trip. By this point, Luna should have really been highlighted. More scenes with her. More flashbacks. Maybe see what she is CURRENTLY doing? I would have liked to have actually CARED about her. The whole 'we havent seen each other in forever' thing creates a divide between us that doesn't quite work. If she was to remain alive through the game and maybe die at the end, then them not having seen each other for forever might have meant something. But to give her a few scenes, have them SEE each other, and then kill her? How am I supposed to FEEL for her? And damn it, coming from a long time never recovering from Aerith's death, can I tell you how badly I WANT to feel for the love interest! That is MY shit right there! What really gets me weepy! So to deny me of this in a FINAL FANTASY game is like... tragic.

&amp;#x200B;

So after you leave the kingdom, you got the basic story of trying to get to your destination. Car breaks down. Learn a bit about the open world and quests. And it continues as it it did. Now, we get the FULL story of what happens while away. Or at least, we EVENTUALLY do.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is... they want me to watch ANOTHER story elsewhere to understand this part?! You could have totally shown me so much about the King, what he had done, why he is important, why the crystal is important, his abilities, and those who sat next to him during the prologue I spoke of earlier. So even if I can't be allowed to see all that happens in Kingsglaive, I should have gotten pieces of it throughout the story. Beginning here. So that I ALSO care about how much this affects Noctis. Again, I need to feel for these characters. So why not help me do that? Either now, or by the end. I dont mind them changing my opinion of someone through the course of the game. LIke I keep getting to see things that make me go, 'man, this king was so nice! I like him so much! Now I feel I wish I knew more before he died!'. Nope. None of that is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Now after all that, you get a couple of main goals. But they are so half hazardly put together and all the inbetween stuff only makes this worst. I need to find Luna, get my weapons, and get my astrals. Okay. Good. But the problem is, each start of a mission is a whole chapter. Like, you accomplish ONE thing and the chapter ends? And the world being open for a few chapters without the use of Umbra also kind of breaks the pacing between these events. It consistently feels like a whole lot of nothing is happening between these events. Now, you can maybe remedy that a LITTLE by going straight to the main story and skipping side quests until the end. However, you give people an open world and they are going to explore.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts on this? They should have opened the world slowly. Through each chapter. And by doing this, they could have put more emphasis on the side quests and visiting each location. You have your main objective for the chapter, but you also have all these camps to draw memories from. All these side quests that bring the boys together. Instead, we get a series of glorified fetch quests that really don't offer anything or really open up the world. Again, some do. But I mean, when you arent making he feel things for the boys, you can at least enrich the world. Quests that basically delve into the past and help me understand all the events that lead to this point in time. Different things the Empire did, ect. Rather than giving me random data logs or news bulletins, or dropping it all on me at the end of the game... enrich the world itself through side quests.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to recap some of that... I basically constantly felt like a third wheel. I learned nothing of my main heroes. The main story points felt like they were cliff notes. So much wasted potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes chapter 13. I realized Niflheim is empty. People are all gone. Big twist and turns are awaiting me!  Oh, I am given a choice to play Gladio. I should do that first right? ... oh, I skip pretty much all of Noctis' story instead of picking up where Noctic begins... who decided this was a great idea? But hey, they added this LATER apparently because originally they werent going to tell you SHIT about Revus. So lets dive into that.

&amp;#x200B;

They make a big thing with a scene about who will obviously be our big enemy players. I am expecting many up coming battles with them. I get... one? And then immediately we end up on the same side later. Awesome. And Revus, okay, this guy is strong! Bad ass! We gonna fight bro!..... or not. Or we can have this one convo. I see you and Luna have a convo. And then I am just supposed to find you dead?! WHY DID YOU RUIN THIS CHARACTER?! He could have been a rival I struggle to beat for a while!!

&amp;#x200B;

And the rest of the bad guys. The Emperor makes no sense. The scientist guy I cant even recall his face. And the other general I captured for two seconds just vanishes? WHY DO I FEEL SO LOST?! And what of the Diamond Weapons in the beginning?! Why have I still not fought you?!

&amp;#x200B;

And then a stream of info is just DUMPED on me. I cant even hear Ardyn's great monologue about why he is doing what he is doing because for some reason they decided that Noctis' grunts should be in the foreground instead of quiet in the background. Prompto is a clone or something?! Why is this not hinted like AT all. Brought up through multiple scenes. Especially encounters with the bad guys or talks about the Empire making him look odd. Or a reservation to fight the MT's. Like, so many ways you could have done it. Instead he vanishes for a bit and I guess I gotta play his DLC to actually not feel lost? That should have been part of the game ITSELF. In fact, every time a character vanishes it should have been part of the game where I jump over to them. And of course, the main characters downplay it like, 'no one cares where you are from, you are our buddy!' which would have felt AWESOME if this was more prevalent in the actual course of the story!

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, I reach the ending. Noctis wants a picture. At this point, you finally get it. The entire story, the entire game, it was about the journey itself. About the memories shared between these four friends. All that they experienced together. It was supposed to be about their roadtrip/struggle up to this very point. Or it should have been. Again, I suggested earlier that having a series of camp flash backs, side stories (the ones they DID do barely offered anything new); or side quests with a unique NPC for each outlook area. Because if they did this, I would have had all kinds of MEMORIES too! Instead, I have no memories. I can barely remember what some of the pictures were from. Most were from main story points that felt like cliff notes.

&amp;#x200B;

And the shame? The shame is that this is the most brilliant idea I have seen in a long arse time. I mean, I would have had SO many emotions. I am a very emotional guy. I LOVE THIS KIND OF SHIT. Like, when that happened, I felt a bit empty. Especially the realization that this was the end of the road. They were about to lose their friend, that tied them all together. Things will NEVER be the same for them. The journey with your friends. Like those friends you made in school. That you made memories with. Spent years of your life with. How you grow up and you never see each other again. THAT KIND OF EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE. Realizing I am growing older, nothing is forever, this stuff is heavy and it is as depressing as FF13's Lightning Return (which, dont get me started on why they are going all emo on me these days in FF, haha).

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much wasted potential in this game that it makes me cry. I mean, I spent all night feeling empty as well. And for the WRONG reasons. I wanted to feel empty because I beat the game. Because the realization of these revelations. Because of the memories I made on my journey and having to say goodbye to a friend. Instead, I felt empty because of how much more this story could have made me feel. All the lost potential.

&amp;#x200B;

I wont really talk about combat because there are a lot of areas I would improve. However, I will say it is one of my favorite battle systems and am sad this game didnt do better because I would LOVE to see more of it. I loved the multiple weapons. The conjuring of the weapons. The Armiger. Like, yes, more please.

&amp;#x200B;

But really, this is about the story. My god they had the makings of a master piece. It could have been my most favorite FF to date. My favorite story. I see all the areas they could have improved. I read leaks that might not be true, but those leaks had a more coherent and well organized story than this. Just reading the 'cliff' notes felt more detailed and put together than what we got. There are parts of those leaks I would have preferred. But even with what we got, I imagine what we COULD have done with it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is in no way bashing the game. Just... man... at Chapter 13 things escalated fast and there was so much more emotion I could have felt that was missed. The surprises could have been better. The deaths better. And of course the whole, 'its been 10 years, go past start, don't collect 100 dollars, fight the last boss now' felt so rushed. I wanted time to explore this new world. Did we HAVE to sleep for 10 years? Or at least spend more time trying to fix things before realizing we have to take the fight to Insomnia? I could go on all day. But I will leave it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

If they ever released a PS5 version that completely redid the first 12 chapters... I would buy it up in a heart beat. I feel that with everything in place, it wouldnt be THAT hard to actually implement a number of these ideas. To just bulk up each chapter more and fill it with lore, character development, and what not. Think any other FF. How there are a ton of major side things happening that the characters have to deal with on the way to each location. This game lets you skip all that. Which makes it feel rushed and copy and pasted. If they forced you off the beaten path on journey's that actually expand your horizon, they could add a lot of meat with little effort.",t2_5hin3x83,False,,0,False,[SPOILERS] Thoughts after completion,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THOUGHTS + RUMORS'}]",r/FFXV,False,6,theoriesrumors,0,,False,t3_erazfp,False,light,,public,16,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},THOUGHTS + RUMORS,False,16,,False,spoiler,1579512452.0,,[],{},,,True,,1579540878.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.FFXV,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years and then four more years later... and I finally got around to playing this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was originally far more excited for it than FF13 when it was announced. Waited forever. Then got worried with the reviews. To me, the Final Fantasy series is a staple in story telling. I have been let down before, but this game truly took the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FF13 was too convoluted. Though I did enjoy it&amp;#39;s two sequels. It was just a headache to follow. But I give them props for the amount of effort they DID pour into the story.FF12 was one that I just felt was empty. It had everything there, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t find myself drawn to any of the characters or world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then comes FF15. A game with SO much potential that I feel especially empty upon reaching the ending. A road trip among four friends... how can we POSSIBLY screw up that kind of emotional payload?! The first 90% of the game does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like a COMPLETE third (or well, fifth?) wheel; I need to watch Brotherhood. Why? Why didn&amp;#39;t they redo these episodes in the ACTUAL game? How great it would have been to get little snippits like this. In fact, every camp spot should have had at least maybe ONE scene. SOMETHING like a flashback or a shared moment. Nothing HUGE, just... something more. They forget that we did not create these characters. We did not spend time growing up with them. We are the stranger entering a new group of friends we just made who are all like, &amp;#39;remember that one time Noctis fell asleep?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;OH YEAH! That was SOOOO funny!&amp;quot; and I am like, &amp;#39;context please?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

115,,FFXV,"Just started the game and I'm enjoying it so far (compared to FFXIII which was awful). I'm up to Chapter 3 and I was wondering if we get any other party members besides the default 3 other than Noctis. I actually like all of them so far, but I also like having variety of other characters to play with.

“hi square if one day u decided that u want to redeem yourselves due to hurting us with leaving ffxv a mess then why not re-release it or make a COMPLETE edition for next-gen consoles with this:

possible:
- HARD MODE
- bahamut summon
- all the DLCs
- revive the 2 festivals
- revive luna’s deleted cutscenes
- make kingsglaive watchable through an option
- add parting ways and DoTF novel through an option (make like an audiobook where the character themselves read it for u)
- EBONY LEVEL EDITOR. pls release what u promised
- maybe playable platinum demo? it’s part of the story right?
- add those damn mini-games from stadia. i know those games ain’t sh*t but still i want them
- also brotherhood. they free right? wouldn’t hurt to add them as watchable through that game itself now huh?

one could only hope:
- cartanica exploration
- tenebrae exploration
- more altissia exploration
- revive DoTF DLCs

or atleast make it like a royal pack or something so we could atleast finally get the final fantasy of our dreams

119,,FFXV,"Let me preface this by saying I'm new to FFXV insofar as I'm on my first run. Years ago I had no interest in playing it so I watched an LP. Eventually though I warmed up to what I saw and I got the game while it was on sale for Christmas on Steam.

I'm still heading to Altissia. Have been for about 20 hours and as many levels.  I know what is coming and so I don't want to leave. I want to just keep doing as many sidequests and stuff as possible. I'm gonna be looking into teh various ""Tours"" soon and then finally advance the plot.

I think everything to do with the four main characters and their dynamic is excellent and probably the ultimate selling point of the game. However I'm a long time FF fan and I think FFXV, while it avoids many pitfalls of FFXIII, follows in its footsteps in that it focuses 90% of the story on the main characters. It does a better job with side characters than FFXIII did but I still think it could have done more.

Take Iris for example. Dunno what the shipping scene is like in FFXV but Iris is a way better fit for Noctis than lunafreya. Actually having that time spent with Iris gives us a connection to her. Yet even that was too short. My memory was faulty from the LP I watched and she does not join the party as a FFXII style Guest like Larsa or Reddas. She's there for one dungeon maybe and that's it. I don't think it would have hurt the game at all to have her as a more long term guest. By all means keep it as just the four for the whole game as that is its greatest strength. But a guest to bring along for some sidequests would have been cool. I would have definitely liked to see more of Iris.

a couple things made sense to me after the story ended, like the logo. when you first load into the game, there’s a weird looking logo that has no relevance to the game whatsoever. until the final scene. when i realized that the logo was a picture of noctis and lady lunefraya sitting on the throne, i cried that much harder. in chapter 9, i think, sid drove noctis and his team to altissia via boat. he then said to trust in your friends, and never doubt them. the whole storyline highlighted the friendship between noctis and the others, forming a truly unbreakable bond that the player could relate to. i realized that when noctis was floating in space, defeating aldyn, ehat his friends were beside him. his friends must have fought the giants and died, coming to stand beside noctis even in death. they were with noctis, even till the very end(and then some). again, this made me cry even harder.  the significance of the pictures that prompto took throughout the story shone through. looking back through all the journeys and memories to find a photo, i started to cry. i wasn’t ready for the story to be over so soon, and i was attached to these characters. there was also other stuff that clicked after the game, but that would take be another couple pages to explain lmao

I am late to the party, it took me a long time to get XV for PC and even longer to play it, and then even longer to complete it. 

Honestly I've hated this game for the first half of the game, it's obviously a ""first try"" for the FF series in a lot of the things it does, the Open World aspect can be weird, the combat is sometimes sluggish and sometimes on point, the enemies just kinda stand there while you hammer on them and then attack you without feedback or anything.

The game isn't perfect, at all. But one thing always stood out to me: the relationship between the four main characters, every time I camped, every time we talked, every time they would come up with random quips at each other, or compliment each other's combat, it all was very unique for a game, so I stood around to see where the story went.

But that finale. That finale hit me so hard, from the moment you pick your picture from the ones you saved, to Regi dealing the final blow, the final camp scene. 

I cried like a baby through it all, I loved every moment of it, I can say that this game's journey was worth it, through all the ups and downs the boys were always there, and in the end it's because of their relationship that this game was elevated from being a game that I only wanted to ""get over with"" to see the story, to one of my favorite stories in recent JRPGs, to the point of wanting to find stories like it.

137,,FFXV,"Dear community,

after a long break I’ve decided to return to Eos and want to find out, what happened content-wise over the last 2 years.

I finished the game in 2017 with about 117 hours. I hit max level with all characters (120) and stopped playing around the time Comrades came out. I finished some of the post game dungeons (missing e.g. Costlemark tower) and still have some hunts to do.
I killed Naglfar and a high level mark on a military base (can’t remember the name).
I also finished Pitioss.
As I’ve discovered, a lot of content updates were released over the last 2 years. I have the official strategy guide, which is quite detailed but missed the updated content of course.

So I guess my question is, what are some of the biggest changes and new content that I should check out? I downloaded the Royal Pack FYI.
Oh, and has level scaling of the enemies been added to the New Game+?

175,,FFXV,"I know I'm late to the party but I just played through FFXV Royal Edition, which I got earlier this week. Finished the main story and I liked it very much.

 The story is almost archetypal and in a way very simple, with parallels and almost stereotypical characters. But what made me like the game more, was how the relationships were built. I jumped into the game without watching any movies or reading any backstories, and I loved the way I just immediately was a part of this group of friends. They interacted with each other quite naturally and I truly felt their struggles and emotions, especially at the end. 

The carelessnes of the beginning turned quickly into a more serious quest, and at the end everything started to go downhill pretty fast. The game created a false sense of security with it's slow start and that's why I think every tragedy, fight and interaction between the guys felt more real towards the end. 

As I have read some online forums after completing the game, I've found people complaining over the convoluted and complicated plot, which makes me glad that I didn't dive into the lore too much. I didn't care about some plotholes that there may have been, because to me the story was rather simplistic in its core. So I might have a completely different perspective to this game, than some other fans who have spent hours upon hours catching up with the games lore, and that's fine to me. Great thing about literature, paintings, games, music or any kinds of art is that we can enjoy and interpret them subjectively. 

Of course this wasn't the worlds best game, that's obvious. But it's what I was searching for right now. Combat was interactive and fun, exploration was simple but rewarding, side quests or hunts didn't feel completely useless. The world was beautiful and diverse, and the story+characters were good. 

I don't really know as to why I wrote this, this game just really was the right game at the right time for me. I guess I just wanted to appreciate the good things that it did. After some time I'll probably dive more into the side content, altough right know going back to the camping and hunting wouldn't probably feel quite right. 

Altough this was a great experience I probably wont buy other FF games since the turn based combat is a major turn off for me. Also as far as I know they are quite different from this one aswell, altough as I've now gotten to know, they seem to be much more liked by the FF community, or atleast not as divisive.

194,,FFXV,"Hello people,

After playing the unpatched game at its release on XB1 (without the DLC) and then playing the Windows Edition with Steam,

I can say i have finished the game and can uninstall after 241 hours and the 97 Achievements:

This is a sheet in french i made for collection purpose

There are several things you will see I have that i shouldn't (Feather photo filter, Medjay Shield and Outfits, JM5 Sticker, Assassin's Stickers, Choco Sticker, and 2 Accessories)

I successfully added all the RED stuff too but it seems there is something that need to be checked in the savefile to confirm having them (Sims outfit, T-shirsts (I didn't preorder), Katana Dodanuki (Windows Store only), Cup Noodle Helmet)

I hope some will find it useful (after some translation) and bid you good game

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Comrades was a slog and i have some friend to thanks for the help to get through it BUT the story was really enjoyable (after several hours of grind after each bit of story)

Korean developer [JSC Games](http://www.jscgames.com/) have announced today (via various news outlets, such as the [FNTimes](http://www.fntimes.com/html/view.php?ud=202001071305554049ee0209bd21_18), and [CSTimes](http://www.cstimes.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=326269)) that they are jointly developing the *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* (tentative name) with [GAEA](https://www.gaea.com/) and [Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group](https://www.opg.cn/cn/), based upon Square-Enix's *FINAL FANTASY XV*. The game will also be published by Shanghai Oriental Pearl for the Chinese market.^1

The new game has a few differences to the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* previously released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and most recently for Microsoft Windows. 

The story is set within another world parallel to the world of *FINAL FANTASY XV* and begins immediately after Prince Noctis and his retinue begin their journey. Players will become the protagonist and travel the world with friends in order to save it from various threats. Other new content will be included, such as the previously existing world map being expanded upon with new areas such as continents floating in the sky. 

Unlike the gameplay of original release of *FINAL FANTASY XV*, the new mobile game has been characterized as the following: 

&gt; * The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is being developed as a large-scale MMORPG using the Unreal Engine 4.
&gt; 
&gt; * They aim to go beyond the single-player scope of combat present in the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* by providing a variety of battles for players to cooperate with other players to complete.
&gt; 
&gt; * Gameplay involves simple touch controls.

Park Ji-young, CEO of JSC Games said, “The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is a game with an immersive story, fascinating characters, and it captures the unique sensibility of a Japanese RPG. We are committed to doing our best to bring both the action and graphics of the console experience to mobile.”

Additionally, a trailer will be released during the first half of this year, but an exact date has yet to be confirmed. 

No release date or comprehensive information about what regions the game will be released in has been announced.

I assume four, but if we&amp;#39;re short a man, does it fill that with an AI, or is there even a recommended amount?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time, and have a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;

257,,FFXV,"Belated happy new year to all my fellow players and enthusiasts of the game, and to those who feel both disdain and warmth to the FFXVs journey throughout its apparent lifespan.

I am about to tell a story not so exciting, but I personally am moved to share this, because in real life, I cannot find any people appreciating this story, aside from my girlfriend, who is significantly the catalyst of this story. :)

I am an introvert.( This is my intro and its done ) Also have anxiety and depression. But I am fighting.

I am one of those who bought this game at day 1, pre-ordered deluxe version and played it around 2016 - 2017. Though I have never completed it 100% back then, I can say I was amused of the battle system and the ""lore"" it was trying to convey.

Like other players, I also felt the effect of the rushed and messy development of FFXV, feeling both great and hanging with the game's final cutscene.

Around late 2017-2018 I stopped caring and even playing like before, maybe got into it like 30 mins or 1 hr, because it bugged me to buy DLCs just to get a better experience ( this is not a rant, but please bear with my narrative ). So I decided to play the game, until I have a family ( which is not too far but right now still not doing progress about having my own family ).

I met my girlfriend around 2018, we have a very unique story, and we didnt meet like most couples do. We both played the risky game, painfully but courageously facing discoveries about each other \~ strengths and weaknesses alike. She is not a gamer, not even close to knowing some older games but that wasn't something that I saw her as a weakness in our relationship. It was a stereotype-breaker for me, finally meeting someone, someone entirely different, but reciprocating feelings and acceptance.

Fast forward to December of 2019. I decided to go back to her hometown, province, country side, lands are underdeveloped, the culture of people not sulking to internet, social media, and the feeling of genuine relationships and conversations without the pretext of social status, is very prevalent in her hometown. That is also something I dreamed of experiencing in this life of mine. (Lestallum is like where I came from, Insomia is comparable to where we usually work, and her hometown, is not far to Cape Caem's feel)

I understood, the moment I stepped to their land, people there, have different culture. The stereotypes in their culture vastly differs from my stereotypes. So I planned, my 5 days spent there, immersing myself in their culture and community, will be the best of the lifetime.

I brought my PS4, with only one game, FFXV. I didnt bring Tekken 7 because I am worried the little kids might be inspired being violent with one another, so yeah.

First day, I did not put on the PS4, because I am really anxious about her parents, and older siblings, not being ""accepting"" of the idea of playing a video game.. Her parents are both past 60+, and older siblings past 30+..

Second day, I put on the PS4, played Kingsgalive, and finally, my girlfriend was able to watch it, after almost 1 year and more of me trying to make her watch it.

Not only did she watch it, her dad, younger bro, and older sisters watched it.

She asked: "" So, whats gonna happen to the ring King Regis gave to Luna? ""

Me: "" Oh, we'll find out, when we play the game itself""

All my remaining days, we put time to play the game, no sidequests and hunts for now, only the main-line quests.

I was shocked, her Dad, her Mom, her siblings ( young and old ) and some other relatives, were hooked and more focused than I am. The fighting, made them excited, the monster designs, the world that FFXV was trying to convey, they were particularly appreciating it, not saying it perfect, but appreciating what IS than what coudve been. My girlfriend tried fishing, and riding chocobos, driving, and experienced the first few chapters.. We got until Fociaugh Hollow I think... 

Now I know why they put the line "" A FINAL FANTASY FOR FANS(me) and FIRST TIMERS(her and her family)""

They were more receptive of the story, of what the game has to offer, than me, a self-proclaimed gamer and fan of the franchise.

Now, I realized, I need to buy the Royal Pack, and the other DLCs for me to show them the complete experience the next time I visit their place, or having to experience the game with me and her having our own family.

265,,FFXV,"So, I made a thread about this already. It was last year or something, long ago, I don't really know when and honestly I don't feel like searching for it again. I may have made two threads even.

These are my specs

* Windows 10 Pro
* Intel core i5 7600K 3.80 GHz
* 16 GB RAM
* NVIDIA 1060 GTX 6 GB RAM

I am running the game on 1920x1080 and with texture quality High, everything else is Low or disabled. I will say right away that at times, I was playing on everything high and everything low, kind of flip-flopping between them because I didn't know when the issue was still there or not, it occurs either way and here it is:

My game

1. crashes randomly for no apparent reason
2. runs perfectly at 60 FPS but in certain fights (I tried Naglfar just now and it crashed) the FPS drop down to like 10 for a few seconds before recovering, with struggling to do so.
3. Sometimes nothing really happens (the chocobros running or standing around, doesn't really matter) and the FPS drop down to 1 for a full second before going back to 60.

So I had these issues in the past already, around release of the PC version, and I tried asking people about it. People told me to use this ""Virtual Memory"" option that creates a pagefile.sys (It is 16 GB big right now, probably filled up while I was playing before it eventually crashed today) I enabled it and the issue seemed resolved.
Apparently it was because of a RAM leak?

But as I continued the game the issues just came back for no apparent reason. The memory leak issue kind of vanished for people and some of my friends even said that ""it was fixed"", but I don't seem to have any changes and my game crashes/lags still as much as it did on release.

When asking on reddit or people in the FFXV Discord people were like ""well, I speedrun the game and have no issue. It must be your system of some sort.""

Today I tried playing it again and was enjoying myself for about an hour or two until it just crashed again. I REALLY want to know why this is still going on for me and I can't wrap my head around it. Is my system outdated? I can play many other games just fine, including games that are newer. I don't know if its just the PC port having issues or my system at this point, really.

The real kicker for me was when my friend told me that he had ZERO issues playing the game: never crashed for him, never lagged for him. Constant 60 FPS without any trouble, smoothest experience ever, and his system is actually weaker. He had a GTX 960 (at the time) 12 gigabytes of RAM and Windows 7. He was running it on an HDD too. I just don't understand how he never had to deal with this stuff but I do.

337,,FFXV,"I have an issue with my recently bought Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition from PS Store.

I enjoyed the original vanilla experience years ago, somewhat.

I was very psyched about getting a chance to play the game with all of its DLC episodes and new performance updates on PS4.

As usual the PS4 UI would ask upon download which of the many (+20) said DLC items I would like to install. Unfortunately, I was not aware the game would install some of the said add-ons in the Royal Edition without my consent. This includes unwanted DLC such as ""Item: Travel Set"", ""Item: Gourmand Set"", ""Item: Angler Set"", ""Booster Pack"" and ""Booster Pack+"", all of which I absolutely do not want to interfere with my gameplay experience.

The worst offenders being probably the Travel Set which cuts 50% off from all in-game hostel prices and fuel and somesuch ""travel expenses."" I have no intention to make the game any easier for me than it already was. If anything I'd prefer a way to make it more challenging.

This is supposed to be ""optional content"", but right now – for me – I can not find a way to get rid of said content.

I have tried deleting and reinstalling the game now countless times. I only seem to be able to control the installation of the larger DLC episodes, but not any of the previously mentioned files.

I've been in contact with my regional PlayStation customer support but they are not offering me any help to fix the license issue.

As far as I know, my PSN profile and thus the game is now forever tainted with said add-ons that cannot be undone if I wish to play the game in the latest 1.29.

If only I had bought all the wanted DLC individually **one by one** and perhaps I could've evaded this issue.

345,,FFXV,"Hi guys, just got back in the game after buying my new rig. It's running fairly smooth at 70 FPS on Ultra with Pure Light shaders, but sometimes I'll just enter a battle and it bogs down the game to 17-18 FPS and stays there, regardless of me pausing, alt-tabbing or killing every enemy. It just jumps staight from 70 to 17 FPS, and it takes about a minute before it climbs back up super-fast to 70 FPS.

It's not like I see my system dropping a couple of frames when a lot of stuff is happening on screen. It literally jumps from 70 to 17 instantly, and locks itself to that framerate. Luckily, it happens only a couple times per game session, but it's really bothering me.

What exactly is causing this to happen? I am hovering fairly close to my 8GB vRAM all the time, around 7.5GB, but my monitoring software doesn't record it breaking the 8GB, so I'm not sure that's the issue.

SETTINGS:

\- 1440p resolution, 120fps in settings

\- All Ultra, with VXAO off, lighting High instead of Very High, and Filtering to Low

\- ReShade with Pure Light preset (I tried toggling it off and on when the bug happens, and I stay locked at 17-18fps. It's not ReShade or a hardware performance issue....)

\- EDIT: I tried setting TRAM to High instead of Highest and that didn't fix the problem.

My story, like many others, I completed the game and now am in Chapter 15 doing random stuff (2 dungeon keys left and Pitoss). Completed all other quests up to this point, have all the fish, all the dishes, all the hunts. So I've tried to do almost everything.  


Well, I now decided to buy the Royal Edition and have the dilemma that so many have asked about. How do I go play the new chapter 14. My understanding is that I have a few options but all of them have negative, please correct me if I'm wrong:  


1 - start a NG+ and play everything from scratch  
2 - use chapter select to start from chapter 14 and again I lose progress on a lot of stuff that Ive just recently completed in chapter 15  
3 - start the chapter 14 intro quest from chapter 15 but then miss out on loot, boss fight, cut scenes etc.  


Couple questions :  


A - if I do a NG+ or chapter select (my understanding these work the same way), will my list of fish caught, recipes all still be there?  
B - I think I might be looking at this issue all wrong with wanting to have everything on 1 save when in fact thats not really necessary. At the end of the day whats the lesser of 3 evils above? I've heard some say, do a chapter select, play the new chapter 14. Once done, go back to your ""main save"" and then go back and do chapter 14 again.

I don't like open world games because they often take a long time to complete 100%, and I don't have much time to play.

I also know that FFXV has had a troubled development, and that this has ruined the final product. As if that wasn't enough, I seem to have understood that the last expected DLC has been canceled.

I don't have a gaming PC, but I have a PS4 Pro. Currently the Royal Edition on the PS Store is at € 17.49 (about $ 19.39 - £ 14.99).

When I backed out, I realized that Gladio didn&amp;#39;t have an EXP wheel under him. It was as if he wasn&amp;#39;t actually in the party, but was at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fixed itself once I left, but I was curious- Has anyone else experience? I looked it up, and couldn&amp;#39;t find any mentions of this bug.  &lt;/p&gt;

367,,FFXV,"I know it's boring and a waste of space and time, but if you guys are having problems with stuttering on Steam with FFXV, could you please try downloading the additional 4k texture pack? You don't even need to have it activated, you just have to download it and then try to play the game for a bit. 

I know this sounds like a weird solution, but on my PC it has almost entirely eliminated any stutter I had and game has become much smoother. I know it doesn't make sense but it's literally the only thing I've changed.

Some problems still persist though, like water attacks from the crocodiles near Galdin Quay tanked my FPS and GPU usage from locked 60 and 75% to 4-10 and 99%, causing many stutters.
I also suspect the frog spell from Nagas will still tank fps, and even the game loading the rainy environment, but I still have to test them.

If you guys try this, could you please report back?

374,,FFXV,"I’ve recently started playing FFXV after almost 2 years of not playing it/playing other games etc. And I have to say man what a great game it is! I remember being not too amazed by the story but the ending hit me right in the feelings because I loved them boys! The main cast is so good and they have such a great chemistry that I can’t help but like them. They’re definitely in my top 5 faves FF protagonists. Especially Noctis. He’s very likable and fun to play.
Anyway, rediscovering this game is being such a nice pleasure. It still looks really pretty, the gameplay is fun, and the world is believable. I’ve heard many people saying that the world isn’t believable but I disagree. Their argument was that since there are monsters around, why aren’t all the towns and outposts fenced or have walls? Simple, they are only afraid of the daemons. And to fend those off they just need the lights. And the regular wildlife is mostly there minding their own business. In case of regular animals attacks, hunters are a prominent presence in the FFXV world so I don’t see the problem! The world feels like it could be a real place most times and that’s probably why I can play 5hrs straight without noticing lol.
I also really love their design choices. The clothing in general is just so cool, and the weapons (even though most of them are medievalish weapons) are all techy and look like a sci-di version of their medieval counterparts. The towns look realistic and the panoramas are so beautiful! I love to use the regalia on auto and pan the camera to look at the landscape... Eos looks like a place where I’d want to go on vacation.

One thing that I still don’t like/care for is the fact that the important dlcs are paid when those parts of the story should’ve been in the game to begin with. I’m referring mostly to the Gladio/Prompto/Ignis dlcs. I wish they had put a cutscene at least that showed what happened. The game still stands on its own quite well, but I really wished they had put in a little something since the were going to make paid dlcs for those parts. Still, the main story is okay nonetheless.

Edit: I’m currently at chapter 3, exploring and doing side quests for fun.

\*Disclaimer: The Episode DLCs tend to have spoilers for the ending, so if it's your first time playing I'd definitely move those to the end.

\*\* Note: Dawn of the Future doesn't have an english version available yet. I just put it at the end based on what I read the story will be about.

Final thoughts: I haven't played since 2017. Back then my opinion was that this was a really good FF game, but suffered due to some terrible pacing and story telling in the back half. Obviously, the ending was as good as any in a game even back then in spite of the lacking second half. My opinion after replaying with all the content is that the story is as good as any other FF story as a whole, but is really held back by the fact that it's spread across entertainment mediums and requires making a guide on which order it should be experienced in. If Square Enix would've just cut the spoilers from the episode DLCs, inserted little prompts to play them in the right spot, and found a way to work the rest of this content into the actual game (e.g. replacing the opening cutscene with the omen trailer), then FFXV would go toe-to-toe with the greats in the series.

&lt;p&gt;*Disclaimer: The Episode DLCs tend to have spoilers for the ending, so if it&amp;#39;s your first time playing I&amp;#39;d definitely move those to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Note: Dawn of the Future doesn&amp;#39;t have an english version available yet. I just put it at the end based on what I read the story will be about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final thoughts: I haven&amp;#39;t played since 2017. Back then my opinion was that this was a really good FF game, but suffered due to some terrible pacing and story telling in the back half. Obviously, the ending was as good as any in a game even back then in spite of the lacking second half. My opinion after replaying with all the content is that the story is as good as any other FF story as a whole, but is really held back by the fact that it&amp;#39;s spread across entertainment mediums and requires making a guide on which order it should be experienced in. If Square Enix would&amp;#39;ve just cut the spoilers from the episode DLCs, inserted little prompts to play them in the right spot, and found a way to work the rest of this content into the actual game (e.g. replacing the opening cutscene with the omen trailer), then FFXV would go toe-to-toe with the greats in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think of the order? I definitely think some of this content can float to more than one spot in the list, bu this is the order I prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to wait for the triumphant trio to pull their thumbs out of their asses and actually attack a lvl 51 Aramusha is like watching hair grow. The video below is of another one of the quests, which I actually ended up completing after restarting the game. This time, however, it seems the chances of it not glitching out are nil. Must have been a fluke the last time I beat a quest there. Also, when I leave EXINERIS it starts me out underneath Lestallum. Like literally underneath the city, looking up at it. I know they&amp;#39;re just hunts, but I&amp;#39;d really like to complete them. My OCD is spinning mud right now.&lt;/p&gt;

Who is she, and who is she waiting for?\n\n**Nomura:** I can\'t reveal that yet. But I can say that whoever she is waiting for, Sora knows their name.""\n\nThus, this can\'t be Strelitzia since Sora hasn\'t heard the name Lauriam yet, which Strelitzia would only know her brother as at the time of her death. Yozora, though, is on the table, since he heard that name back in Toy Box and it\'d explain the surprise/confusion he had at hearing it, since he only knew Yozora as a video game character at that time.\n\n\\---\n\nBut beyond this, let\'s also take a look at the Nameless Star cutscene itself and view this in a meta sense, particularly in regards to the NS\'s remarks:\n\n**Sora: ""So, whose heart are you?""**\n\n**NS: ""No one\'s anymore. They took away my name--everything about me.""**\n\nThis could go either way, but what if this is actually referring to Square Enix taking away Versus along with the concept of Stella? In both senses, SE took away Nomura\'s VXIII and most of its concepts and turned it into FFXV, which included taking away Stella\'s name and being to create Luna.\n\n**Sora: ""No way. They \\[SE\\] couldn\'t have taken away your heart \\[Versus/Stella\\].""**\n\n**NS: ""Only because it pines for another.""**\n\nAnd this ""another"" can either be interpreted as the original creator behind the Versus XIII concept itself - Nomura - or Noctis, the original love interest for Stella.\n\n**Sora: ""Yeah? Someone\'s \\[VXIII director (Nomura)/Noctis\\] coming for you?""**\n\n**NS: ""I cannot be certain. He\'s \\[VXIII director (Nomura)/Noctis\\] been changed beyond recognition--his heart replaced with another\'s.""**\n\nAdmittedly, I think this part more so closes in on Noctis after he was taken away from Nomura and changed into the Noctis we know now in XV, hence ""his heart replaced with another."" Alternatively though, I believe it could also be interpreted as Hajime Tabata, the director of FFXV, referring to how Nomura was replaced with Tabata as the director of the project.\n\n**NS: ""But, were he \\[FFXV director (Tabata)/FFXV Noctis\\] to regain his old self \\[VXIII director (Nomura)/VXIII Noctis\\] again, he would be distressed by my absence \\[Versus/Stella\\].""**\n\nAs we can probably infer, Nomura still holds onto his ideas for Versus and wishes to use them, just as VXIII Noctis was connected to Stella.\n\n**NS: ""So I choose to wait here, where he \\[Nomura/VXIII Noctis\\] can find me.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Good. You have to believe.""**\n\n**NS: ""Believe? Oh, you mean know in my heart he will return? Without any proof? \\[without certainty that this idea would come to fruition someday\\]""**\n\n**Sora: ""Exactly, believe. I thought it was all over for me, but a friend of mine looked me in the eye and said, \'You don\'t believe that.\'""**\n\n**Sora: ""So, uh...who did this to you? Heartless steal hearts, so...a Nobody?""**\n\n**NS: ""A...somebody.""**\n\nAgain, looking at NS\'s responses, this could allude to the uncertainty of Nomura getting to realize his ideas. And as for somebody, this could be a blanket term for SE or alternatively (although in a direct light) Tabata changing VXIII into XV and Stella into Luna.\n\n**Sora: ""Really? Hmm... Well, I wish I could help, but my situation\'s no better.""**\n\n**NS: ""You must see to the tasks before you first.""**\n\n**Sora: ""The tasks before me? There\'s so many.""**\n\n**NS: ""All the more reason for you to make an effort.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Yeah, you\'re right. I just wish I knew what to do.""**\n\nAll of this, I\'m admittedly not as sure on and think is a bit shaky. The closest I can imagine is Sora representing KH3 or the KH series at large, in that KH3/KH must attend to its own current story first, of which Nomura has so many ideas he plans to use and needs to resolve first before jumping into his old Versus XIII concepts. Hence, ""all the more reason for \\[KH\\] to make an effort"" to settle its story (with the Remind DLC). At the point in time this was still being developed, it\'s possible not all the ideas and plans for the DLC were decided upon, aka ""I just wish I knew what to do.""\n\n**NS: ""Here you \\[KH\\] are on the brink, and yet you hold on to who you are. You possess a strong sense of purpose. And in that purpose you will find direction.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Thank you. I\'m really glad we met. You cheer me up. I hope that friend of yours \\[Nomura/VXIII Noctis\\] finds you soon.""**\n\n**NS: ""Thank you. Me too.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Oh, hey. If I see him, I\'ll tell him that you\'re here. What\'s his name?""**\n\n**NS: ""(Says the name) \\[Nomura/Noctis aka Yozora\\] Our secret \\[in that this is still unrevealed as of now\\].""**\n\nThe irony is that KH is wishing Versus XIII/Stella to be found soon, when it is now actually being integrated into KH, ala the result of ""I\'ll tell him you\'re here."" Except, it\'s now under the idea of Verum Rex becoming the new Versus and Yozora becoming the new Noctis. And tying this into the concept of TFW itself being the place between sleep and death, Versus XIII is a concept that was thought to be killed by FFXV and has waited in sleep for Nomura to bring his ideas back to life.

The Problem: Game normally runs smooth 60 fps at all times, but starts stuttering when I have too many enemies on screen (threshold seems to be two red giants (flamey swords?) for the lag to occur)  This problem persists even when !!!I'm playing on Low settings with 50% resolution!!!

I even took the excuse to upgrade my cpu and ram. Still persists.

I'm really dunno what I have to do now to fix it. In the tower dungeon with the 20+ mobs on ground lvl it's practically unplayable, even tho GeForce Experience set's my presets to ""Highest"" Yeah... no........

Any ideas what i could do? Thanks in advance. o/

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really dunno what I have to do now to fix it. In the tower dungeon with the 20+ mobs on ground lvl it&amp;#39;s practically unplayable, even tho GeForce Experience set&amp;#39;s my presets to &amp;quot;Highest&amp;quot; Yeah... no........&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas what i could do? Thanks in advance. o/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Which character from the Final Fantasy XV world has made a memorable impression on you? The answers can be from the main characters to the supporting/minor characters (e.g. Cor, Iris, Talcott, Sania Yeagre, Kenny Crow). I favor more than one character, though I list my top three:

* **Regis**, as I sympathize for the onerous weight on his shoulders. From losing his wife Aulea, to raising Noctis alone while defending Insomnia and the citizens. Seeing Regis do what he could to protect Noctis, the people of Insomnia, to Clarus in the battle against Glauca. I have pondered if Regis was ever informed who Ardyn truly was before his death and what Somnus has done to his brother.
* **Ardyn** is to me a sadistic and troglodyte character for abandoning his humanity to hurt people and Noctis who did not wrong him, though the story from Episode Ardyn and the notes from Dawn of the Future helps provide an explanation on why Ardyn is malicious toward the Caelum household. He suffered greatly to be forced in a fate that felt like a great deception, to heal the infected by absorbing the starscourge to being rejected by the Crystal and later told by Bahamut that his role was to shroud Eos in darkness. If I remember correctly Ardyn did not ever learn whether or not Aera was informed what was going to happen to him or whether Somnus knew of Ardyn's fate, so being left with unanswered questions placed a heavy sadness on the character.
* **Noctis** story is a tragic journey he was burdened with, as his fate to give his life for Eos was a cruel preordained decision from the Crystal. Each chapter in the game leading to the final battle was immersive to me and the many interesting people Noctis and his friends encountered were intriguing or amusing. The war with Nifelheim (and Ravus watching cautiously over his sister) was preventing Lunafreya and Noctis to see each other was hurtful, and I did sympathize with the pain Luna and Noctis felt. The only time the two can be together was in the mist of the battle, and that time was only brief and chaotic, no time for the couple to breathe. The bond with Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto and the obstacles that challenged their will and strength was a good example of brotherhood and friendship.",t2_4khwcj2e,False,,0,False,Is there a character that left an impression on you?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THOUGHTS + RUMORS'}]",r/FFXV,False,6,theoriesrumors,0,,False,t3_e6e5d0,False,light,,public,26,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},THOUGHTS + RUMORS,False,26,,False,spoiler,1577011764.0,,[],{},,,True,,1575561826.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.FFXV,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first apologise if another member has make a thread like this one or if this not an interesting topic, I only want to see what other avid players feel on the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

512,,FFXV,"*\* This is a major spolier, in case the flair wasn't enough!*

&amp;#x200B;

I don't read Japanese (yet!), so I didn't read it myself, but based on translations I found online, in the Dawn of the Future (the novel that tells the events of the 3 canceled DLCs) the ending is completely different, and it is SO MUCH better, for many reasons.

Here's a recap of the new ending from [FF Wiki](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Astral#cite_note-4) :

&gt;!Ardyn accumulates power too great for the True King to purge with the Ring of the Lucii, and Bahamut decides to go forth with his original plan of eradicating all life with Teraflare. Bahamut revives Lunafreya and tells her to gather the darkness into her own body and fell Ardyn, his plan to use the darkness itself to energize his ""final summoning.""Operating under the belief that her new calling will save Noctis, Lunafreya embarks to fulfill it, but comes to question the gods' benevolence after meeting Sol Antiquum, a daemon hunter who helps her get back to Lucis (she is also the daughter of Emperor Iedolas). Bahamut tries to stop Lunafreya from communing with Gentiana, but the latter manages to impart Bahamut's true intentions to her. Outraged at the revelation that Bahamut means to cleanse the Scourge from the planet by obliterating it, Lunafreya forges a new plan that defies his will.When Noctis sleeps inside the Crystal, the memories he receives let him understand how Lunafreya forging covenants with the Astrals was gradually killing her. Noctis makes it his mission to save her, and in the end, Bahamut absorbs her darkness to energize his Teraflare. It is blocked by the other Astrals and Noctis, Ardyn, the Lucii and the other Astrals cooperate to destroy Bahamut in both the physical and heavenly realms. As Bahamut is thus destroyed, Astrals and the Crystal itself dissipate, the Crystal purging the planet of the Scourge before shattering. As a final gift before fading, Gentiana heals Lunafreya, weakened as she is from her ordeal as a vessel for the darkness, and wishes her to live a happy life with Noctis.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, this should have been the game's ending, because :

1. The current ending breaks with Final Fantasy tradition. In every FF main title, the lesson is that the Gods, the ruling class, the government or any higher form of authority really cannot be trusted. The hero must always overcome some sort of identity crisis in order to defy this authoritarian regime. Fate, prophecies and god-given orders only serve to mask true intentions, and those true intentions are usually revealed near the end in a twist. In FFXV, the superior power is Bahamut and everybody just follow his commands. The prophecy he imagined simply unfurls. There is no twist.
2. Noctis is not currently a hero, but a martyr. By definition, a hero is someone who overcomes an obstacle or enemy, helping others in the process without expecting anything in return but sometimes also for personal motives nonetheless. In FFXV, Noctis does save the world and everybody in it, but he does so *in compliance* with Bahamut's teaching, and he doesn't have any personal motivation to do so aside from being told he has to. Yes, his father and girl were killed by Ardyn, but he doesn't appear to follow the prophecy in hope of avenging their deaths really, but simply because it is his destiny, his *Ascension*. Him dying at the end of that destiny doesn't make him a hero, but someone who suffered in order to ascend to a greater purpose. That is a martyr, exactly like Luna, like Yuna before her, and Aerith before all of them.
3. Ardyn was not meant to be the real villain of FFXV. He, too, is a victim of Bahamut. It is not explicitly mentioned in the lore, but Ardyn probably received his healing power from Bahamut, since the God gave a similar power to the Oracle bloodline afterward. But the daemons then made Ardyn both immortal and unworthy of the Crystal's blessing. So, what does Bahamut do ? He gives the crown to Ardyn's brother, a total dick and a mass murderer, who also killed his girl, the first Oracle. In Episode Ardyn, the God even implies that it was always suppose to happen this way, so that the prophecy can be realized. 2000 years later, Bahamut now wants Noctis to sacrifice himself to that end. Is that really how a benevolent God should behave ? Ardyn is like Sin in FFX, and Bahamut is like Yu Yevon : the first villain we meet is actually just a proxy. Bahamut sounds to me like a classic FF authoritarian figure thats begging to be overthrown, reminiscent of Bhunivelze in FFXIII. In fact, if you played the FFXIII trilogy (you brave, beautiful soul), you know that the ending of DotF is pretty much in line with the Fabula Nova Crystallis, in which the hero finds a way to summon and defeat a ultimate deity who wants to destroy the world so that some evil force (in this case, the Starscourge) can't ever reach him in his realm. That should have been the twist.
4. Luna finally becomes useful in this new ending. In the game, the Oracle seems dispensable to me. I get that the game needed a female lead, but clearly the story didn't. Noctis could have awaken the Gods by himself. Nifelheim invading his land and killing his dad could have been enough to motivate him. At the end of the day, the world got saved without Luna. Only in death, in the Beyond where Ardyn is sent, does she play a small role by restraining the villain for a second with some light until Noctis unleashes his final attack. Her only other task was to give Noctis the Ring, but she doesn't even manages that, since Ignis actually gives him the Ring. Noctis and Luna don't even speak in person during the entire gameplay. Yet, the [painting of the prophecy](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/True_King?file=FFXV_Genesis.png) places her at the very top. I'm 99% sure the girl in that painting was meant to be Etro, the Goddess that created mankind in the Fabula Nova Crystallis. In Versus XIII, Luna's previous iteration, called [Stella](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Stella_Nox_Fleuret), talked about the ability to see the realm of the dead, which is basically the twist of XIII, since thats where Etro is trapped. Anyway, all of this to say that the new ending changes this dynamic for the better. After being killed in the most predictable manner by the villain, having Luna come back is already a great plot twist, but having her defy the superior authority of Bahamut and truly help save the day does even more than that : it makes her finally worthy of being the game's logo.
5. Finally, this ending ties up some loose ends in the story. Obvious cuts in the game development made the narrative difficult to embrace at first, and even today, piecing it all together is still a laborious process. FFXV was meant to be a part of its own universe, so the game doesn't contain all of its own lore, far from that. I would argue that Kingsglaive, the prequel movie, contributes more to the general narrative than the game, as it better positions everybody for the coming event. Too bad we can't rewrite beginnings too, 'cause that movie should have also been the start of the game, with Noctis as the lead. Anyway, this new ending finally gives proper roles to the women of this title. Not just Luna. Together with Sol, the new girl, Aranea offers a human perpective on Nifelheim and its people, one that makes it difficult to see them as purely evil afterward. Gentiana also defies Bahamut, her superior, to save Luna and Noctis so that they can be a couple, like she and Ifrit used to be. And finally, Noctis, our hero, becomes worthy of that title, by refusing to simply follow orders, by tracing his own fate, with the help of his party, in order to save the world. You know, like in a Final Fantasy game.",,False,,0,False,"The ""Dawn of the Future"" ending should have been the true ending","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THOUGHTS + RUMORS'}]",r/FFXV,False,6,theoriesrumors,0,,False,t3_e4059n,False,light,,public,44,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},THOUGHTS + RUMORS,False,44,,,spoiler,False,,,{},self,,True,,1575164272.0,richtext,6,,,,self.FFXV,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt; This is a major spolier, in case the flair wasn&amp;#39;t enough!*&lt;/p&gt;

I do have some questions (really only one...) about how I can get the “best” experience out of a game that didn’t seem to be completed until two years after initial release.

Oh and I should mention this is my first time playing the game.

1. Does the Royal Pack add any new cutscenes that weren’t included with the free patches?
2. Is Royal Pack worth the extra $15 (and does this dlc ever go on sale????) to get the “best” ending, better combat system (that Unleashed feature thingy), etc?

I’m 130 hours in the game and have only done two of the end game dungeons that need the keys. 

I originally beat this game before royal edition, so there’s story content I haven’t seen yet as well.   I did go get on the boat and did all my fishing etc. 

I’m wondering now, I really want to experience the story again but I’m not sure if I should start fresh or do a new game plus? 

I guess Could travel back to chapter 1 and just start playing from there?   Or is that a bad idea? 

Otherwise I’m just gonna keep playing the end game content and comrades until I beat it all.

start fresh or
New game plus or
Finish all end game content as I am

When the DLC dropped I never bothered to pick it back up or try any of them. I was debating on buying it for PS4 but buying it on PS4 I would have to do everything over again before playing DLC. Do you think it's worth it to buy on another console or to just buy it on xbox one and play the DLC?

I know this is an odd question it's just I dont know if I have it in me to put 100 hours into the main game again. Which is odd since I loved it when I played it.

601,,FFXV,"Well, it’s been a couple of years since I dove into FFXV. FOr some reason, playing Death Stranding really makes me want to play FFXV... 

Onwards, I have a save file where I beat the game, but I have yet to do a lot of the end game stuff. Adamantoise and one last armored.  I have 12/13. 

I played FFXV and beat it before the royal pack. I hear they’ve added some new stuff and story changes as well. 

I’m really wondering a couple of things,

1. Should I just keep playing my current file and finishing the game and all of my extra side quests? Will I get to experience all of the added content?

2. Should I just start over and do new game plus? I am interested in experiencing the story again... but not too excited about having to do all the side quests over. 

3.  Should I just go fresh for a new game with all of the content added? 

4. I have Ardyn, the only dlc I haven’t played, should I save it until I’m done with the rest of the game and comrades? 

5. Isn’t there a book that came out? Is there any lore or content I’m missing? 


Thanks again for anyone who can clarify these things for me. 

I don’t mind just continuing my current game. But I won’t see some of Net he story changes etc. and I kinda wanted to experience the game fresh again...

Its not the keyboard/gamepad stuttering issue, which i already disabled with Special K mod. The framerate is always stable, only some occasional glitchy stutter during combat(not typical frame drop), this stutter is different from the freeze i mentioned above.

&lt;p&gt;Its not the keyboard/gamepad stuttering issue, which i already disabled with Special K mod. The framerate is always stable, only some occasional glitchy stutter during combat(not typical frame drop), this stutter is different from the freeze i mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

1) Why does killing Ardyn remove the entire Starscourge from the planet? The Daemons existed before Ardyn existed and also existed before he was corrupted by absorbing the ""disease"" from the victims. So why does killing Ardyn has any effect on the miasma in the atmosphere disappearing and the all daemons getting cleansed. It's ok to say when the light returns to the planet all daemons outside get killed but there is a chance a few daemons can hide in the shadows and survive. According to the game the miasma comes from the daemons, so basically all of that could happen again?

2) What actually happened when Noctis summoned the old kings of Yore including his father in the final scene? Many sources state they're supposed to kill Noctis to ""go into his body"" so that he brings them to the ""beyond"" dimension with him where Ardyn is going to be after getting killed (and before he revives). I don't get why this is necessary. Isn't the Ring of the Lucii supposed to ""house"" the souls of all the kings and isn't Noctis going there as well when he gets stabbed and dies. If Noctis soul is not going into the Ring then I'd guess he summons the kings' souls from the ring to go into his body but then why is the Ring glowing so much all that? Shouldn't the Ring be ""empty"" and mightless?

3) According to the english subtitles and the proper japanese dub translation (thanks to [spelldaggers.wordpress.com](https://spelldaggers.wordpress.com)): During the final campscene Noctis is saying its too much for him to handle / hurts seeing all of them together camping again which makes him feel really nostalgic. He also said he was prepared during the 10 years in the crystal/made his peace that he knows he's going to die (?) saving the world but this whole campfire-situation with the nostalgic atmosphwere makes him really sad(?). Did his bros also know? If yes how did they know? I cannot remember someone telling them this. Only Bahamut revealed to Noctis he has to die but that was when Noctis got sucked into the crystal. 

4) When Ignis said ""Glad to hear..."" I was like wut - why are you glad Noct is hurting seeing all of them together like this? Does that mean everyone actually feels the same way as Noctis and are glad that Noctis actually said it out loud and got confirmation he also feels this way which they did not know for sure since he's so awkward with his feelings? Does this imply they know that all of them might die and this is the last campfire or are they sad its the last one because noct is going to die?

Isn&amp;#39;t the Ring of the Lucii supposed to &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; the souls of all the kings and isn&amp;#39;t Noctis going there as well when he gets stabbed and dies. If Noctis soul is not going into the Ring then I&amp;#39;d guess he summons the kings&amp;#39; souls from the ring to go into his body but then why is the Ring glowing so much all that? Shouldn&amp;#39;t the Ring be &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; and mightless?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) According to the english subtitles and the proper japanese dub translation (thanks to &lt;a href=""https://spelldaggers.wordpress.com""&gt;spelldaggers.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;): During the final campscene Noctis is saying its too much for him to handle / hurts seeing all of them together camping again which makes him feel really nostalgic. He also said he was prepared during the 10 years in the crystal/made his peace that he knows he&amp;#39;s going to die (?) saving the world but this whole campfire-situation with the nostalgic atmosphwere makes him really sad(?). Did his bros also know? If yes how did they know? I cannot remember someone telling them this. Only Bahamut revealed to Noctis he has to die but that was when Noctis got sucked into the crystal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) When Ignis said &amp;quot;Glad to hear...&amp;quot; I was like wut - why are you glad Noct is hurting seeing all of them together like this? Does that mean everyone actually feels the same way as Noctis and are glad that Noctis actually said it out loud and got confirmation he also feels this way which they did not know for sure since he&amp;#39;s so awkward with his feelings? Does this imply they know that all of them might die and this is the last campfire or are they sad its the last one because noct is going to die?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I&amp;#39;m hella invested in this game and I want to understand all of it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

651,,FFXV,"Title. Aside from Noctis since he’s required for the prophecy, what would you expect the journey to be like if one of the bros wasn’t present? Including their relationship due to missing a character, plus chapter 9/timeskip. Same scenario from the main game plays out. Spoilers! 

- **Gladiolus:** since he’s not here, I would imagine that the workload increases much more on Ignis’ part. Almost to the point of being a full time mom watching over two children (ok, not to that extent, but Prompto and Noctis certainly share a sibling like bond). The journey would be a little more light hearted but stress inducing because you don’t have someone with physical prowess on your side anymore, so they’d have to tread lightly while being hunted by Niflheim or when encountering monsters. Seeing how Gladiolus used to be the one to try and get Noctis on Ignis’ good side, Prompto would likely replace him as the mediator instead. Ignis would likely be more agitated with needing to come up with more strategies to get them by, but somewhat satisfied for being needed. In this instance, I’d also believe that Ignis would form a bond with Aranea, because he would be watching over two people he trusts similar to how she trusts Biggs and Wedge (plus, the dragoon like abilities). She’d probably make a sarcastic remark here or there but encourages Ignis to do his best. During the events of chapter 9 is when the light hearted tone comes to a close. Noctis is trying his best against Leviathan and Prompto is panicking while relying on Ignis to help evacuate the citizens. It’s here where if Episode Ignis still played out the same way, Prompto would be forced to have a change of heart and develop leadership abilities as well as courage that he wouldn’t have until the timeskip. It would also fit the theme of having to make a tough choice, as Ignis made one to save Noctis and Noctis later does the same in chapter 13. If Prompto had more of a courageous and steadfast character from here on out, I could buy players not being able to tell the difference between him and Ardyn during the train scene. But to take it back for a second, as soon as Ignis goes blind is when things become more tense. The dynamic suddenly changes with Prompto likely blaming himself and Noctis for not being able to help out Ignis. Noctis takes it personal and argues with Prompto and would likely bring up Luna’s death against him. It’s here where Ignis snaps them both out of it. However, since there isn’t someone to keep pushing them forward, I could see the group going their separate ways from here. But let’s assume they repair the relationship between themselves. On the train ride to Gralea, Ardyn would likely have Prompto take Gladiolus’ role and not have Noctis hit Prompto off of the train. Chapter 13 still plays as usual, only with Prompto becoming more hardened to threats due to Ignis’ condition as well as him being needed. I can’t say for sure if just the two of them would be able to last those hordes of demons while Noctis has to race for the crystal. In the event that they do, the timeskip happens as normal except Noctis still takes it hard knowing that Ignis never recovered properly. Prompto at this point is effectively Gladiolus with only a slight joke here and there but is much more serious due to the circumstances they face 10 years later. While they go back to Insomnia, the three would recall better times but have no regrets about the events that led up to this point. They instead remember the dynamic between them and make references to it while making their way towards Ardyn. Noctis fulfills the prophecy, but this would probably lead to the most tragic ending since it would give off a “mother losing her children” vibe, as Noctis dies and Prompto doesn’t have a regular lifespan due to being a clone. After a period of time Ignis would be the only one remaining. 

- **Prompto:** without Prompto, the light tone of the group goes away since they’re not very lighthearted to begin with. Sure, you have jokes here or there but without Prompto I would argue that this time they would be devoted to getting to Altissia and later fulfilling the prophecy. It would be more of a fatherly/motherly relationship with Gladiolus and Ignis in regards to getting Noctis to do what he needs to. Because Prompto isn’t here, the journey would also feel less sentimental and more focused on duty. And instead of Ignis being stressed this time around (although he would, just for different reasons) Noctis would be the one under immense stress because he has no one to relax around. He does trust Gladiolus and Ignis, but it’s not the same sort of relationship he has with Prompto. So instead it would be him being furious about his duty and constantly being reminded about what to do. The strain between Noctis and Ignis would become worse, except this time Gladiolus would be the one to mend wounds between them. However, instead of being someone that Noctis would vent to, he would try to cheer up Noctis or try to get him to do things that would get Ignis off of his back (see racing tour at Galdin). They would stop at a few spots that would catch Noctis’ eye (or if Ignis encourages it) but otherwise keep moving forward to Altissia. Gladiolus gets injured again by Ravus and the same scenario plays out when he leaves. This time, Noctis would be forced to cooperate with Ignis as they search for the Mythril. Aranea shows up again, but instead of bonding with Ignis she tells Noctis in a rather blunt fashion that he needs to listen to Ignis if things want to get better between them. She helps them with a hard fought battle against the Quetzalcoatl and all else proceeds normally when Gladiolus returns. When they arrive to Altissia, Cid would likely remind Noctis that from that point on, Gladiolus and Ignis are the ones he should trust most. During the events of Episode Ignis, Gladiolus would be doing his own thing similar to how Ignis was fending off Niflheim. Except he would arrive too late to see Ignis and Noctis injured. Because of his minor relation to Ignis and Gladiolus, I could see Ravus accompanying the group this time around to Gralea instead of traveling by himself. Noctis and Gladiolus duke it out again, except it’s almost physical this time because of how hard all three of them fought in Altissia only to lose so much. Because of this, Gladiolus becomes even more serious from this point onward and with Ignis being blind, I could also see the group splitting up for various reasons. One that stands out the most would be Noctis’ distrust of Ravus even though Ravus had a change of heart but Ignis defends Ravus. So while the group would still be tense because of Ignis’ injury and Ravus’ entry, they would eventually work past their differences and vow to fulfill the prophecy. At this point, Gladiolus and Ravus would also develop respect for one another. On the ride to Tenebrae, Ardyn would probably kidnap Ignis to force Noctis to come to Gralea (which is technically what happened in Episode Ignis, Verse 2 as Ardyn wanted a reason to force Noctis to ascend). Ravus would then explain what happened to the capital and because of his knowledge, he would lead the group to a faster way to Ignis. Once Ignis is rescued, they would fend off demons once more while Noctis heads for the crystal. In this instance, the Emperor would be among that horde wanting to slay Gladiolus, Ignis and Ravus trying to stop Noctis. When the timeskip happens, Ignis and Ravus discuss what Tenebrae was like before Niflheim took over, and Ravus wishes to see the sun rise over it again. Because no one stopped Verstael 10 years ago, Ardyn would have had a corrupted version of Immortalis waiting for the trio and Noctis would’ve had to use the might of the Six to stop it. After it’s defeated, Ravus joins once more to help Noctis fulfill his calling. While in Insomnia, Ravus apologizes to Noctis for the destruction of his homeland and Noctis ignores it, likely saying that Tenebrae fell before it and none of his ancestors were able to stop it. With this in mind, he has the vow of opening up Lucis to all, regardless of birth or circumstances. Ardyn at this point would likely toy with Gladiolus, Ignis and Ravus to enrage Noctis before fighting him. Ardyn is defeated, and before Noctis dies he would thank Gladiolus and Ignis for always having his back even at the worst times and promises to keep Luna happy for Ravus. Noctis dies, and the remaining group watches the sun rise once more. I wouldn’t find this a very tragic ending as opposed to Gladiolus not being there, if only because all three of them would live (in my opinion) and while you do lose out on the value of photos, you could at least recall the events that led up to that point. Assuming Ardyn would make use of Immortalis, he would also threat what little outposts were left to use against Noctis. 

- **Ignis:** and finally, without Ignis the group would change completely. It would be more of a “my best friends and I” feel because there’s no one to constantly remind them of their duty and Gladiolus did want to see what life was like beyond Insomnia. I get a strong feeling that it would be more of a comedy between all three, fun for everyone. It wouldn’t be all fun and games though, since they would struggle immensely. For one, as far as I know Ignis is the only one that can cook. They would struggle with camping, so I could see them trying to replicate a few Hunter recipes to get them by or Cup Noodles. Another reason would be that Noctis has a history of being a bad driver at times, so they would have to cover for expenses if they weren’t careful enough. With no one to manage expenses either, I could also see Noctis and Prompto going crazy with money until Gladiolus puts a stop to it (or vice versa if Gladiolus sees something he wants but doesn’t need). While Gladiolus and Prompto give Noctis strategies, it probably wouldn’t be as effective if one was advised by Ignis. However, Gladiolus knows the lay of the land so he would probably take over for Ignis when it comes to knowing when or how to attack an enemy. As for breaking into strongholds, I could see them enlisting the help of the hunters should things go south while Noctis tries to scout for any threats while infiltrating. Speaking of infiltrating, when Ravus shows up Gladiolus still loses yet again, but in this scenario I would imagine that he doesn’t leave on his journey because leaving Noctis and Prompto on their own is dangerous. It’s because of this that he goes from being a jokester to being frustrated, paranoid and serious that he can’t do his job properly. From here on out, he swears that he’ll never fall to his knees again. So while Noctis and Prompto deal with Gladiolus’ change in personality, they would all head to get Mythril while Aranea pokes fun at Gladiolus. When they acquire Mythril, they ask if she wants to be part of the crew, but she would retort that they wouldn’t have enough money to ever hire her. Before they set sail to Altissia, Cor would apologize as he always does except he notices something off about Gladiolus. So in return, he accompanies them to Altissia. Along the way, Noctis and Prompto are doing their own thing while trying to get used to the serious tone and someone even more serious. Cor would advise Gladiolus to not get hung up on his past failures and to keep moving forward. When they arrive, there would be little time for sightseeing as Cor reminds Noctis that Luna is in town, preparing for the covenant with Leviathan. Noctis would ignore this and hope to see Luna again. The rite happens again, except Cor takes the role of Ignis in Episode Ignis. He would spend time fending off Niflheim while Gladiolus and Prompto evacuate the citizens. Cor would then encounter Ravus, who shows visible anger towards Cor, but Cor also sees that it’s not him that Ravus is after. The two decide to have an uneasy alliance since Cor swore to protect the king. The bickering is also the same, except Cor reminding Ravus to stay focused on his goal. Since Ravus has no respect for Cor like he did Ignis, he would be much more angry at Luna’s death, resulting in a fierce battle between him and Cor with Cor eventually gaining the upper hand at the cost of being exhausted. Ardyn shows up once more to subdue both him and Ravus. Instead of trying to take someone immediately to Gralea to force Noctis to ascend, Ardyn would toy with Cor specifically to see if his moniker (the Immortal) holds weight to his name. Ardyn duels with Cor, easily gaining the upper hand due to his demonic powers. Ravus steps in but even after catching Ardyn off guard Ardyn quickly disposes of him as well. Just before Ardyn seems to land what would be a fatal blow on Noctis, Cor unleashes the last of his strength to take the hit, leaving a massive wound on his *back.* Gladiolus and Prompto finally show up to see Ravus sprawled out and Ardyn ordering imperial soldiers to take Cor instead to Gralea. From here on out is when things get stressful for the group. Gladiolus, ashamed for not being able to protect Noctis for a second time and with not much to show for it (aside from evacuating the citizens) tries as best as he can to muster up composure and to get Noctis to go to Gralea while trying to get over Luna’s death. He would tell Noctis that the past already happened, but Noctis would take it personal and call out Gladiolus for acting weird ever since he lost to Ravus. Gladiolus moves in to strike Noctis but Prompto intervenes and takes the blow instead. Gladiolus is shocked and tries to help Prompto, but Prompto says it’s ok and reminds them that they can’t stop now since Cor was captured. Gladiolus storms off because of Noctis and Noctis tries to help Prompto. On the train ride, Prompto comforts Noctis about Luna’s death and reveals to him what happened in his childhood involving him and Pryna. He also mentions to Noctis to try and not take it so personal with Gladiolus, because he’s also been trying his best. After receiving Katana of the Warrior, things are still tense between the two but they both look at each other and agree to move forward, for now. Meanwhile, Ardyn is having fun torturing Cor to see if Cor is as tough as they say. During this, he also questions Cor’s unwavering loyalty and taunts him about failing to protect Regis. Cor looks at him and says he managed to protect what the king wanted safe, angering Ardyn. Ardyn leaves Cor to rot while he prepares for the arrival of Noctis. Same scenario plays out but in this instance Ardyn wouldn’t give Gladiolus or Prompto their weapons back, taunting them about being too incapable to help Noctis. Along the way, Noctis gets ambushed by the Emperor and is forced to flee. Right as he’s back into a corner, he suddenly regains use of his powers again. He fends off the Emperor until it’s cut down by someone else: Ravus. As it turns out, Ravus was the one that disabled the machine preventing the three from summoning weapons. From this point on, Ravus assists Noctis in trying to help find Cor and getting to the crystal. Eventually, they would meet up with Gladiolus and Prompto and make their way to Cor. When they locate Cor, they find him strung up along with cuts and bruises all over his upper body. Horrified, Noctis frees him and asks if he’s still ok. Cor says he’s fine and is glad that Noctis is still ok. Gladiolus at this point finally loses it and breaks down in anger at the sight of Cor, wondering if he’s really worthy of being the King’s Shield. Cor chastises him, and said that so long as Noctis was still breathing he was still worthy of his duty. Ravus, impressed by the devotion of these men, tells Noctis that their sacrifices should not be in vain and hands him Regis’ sword. Noctis then vows to stop Ardyn. They make their way to the crystal, where they fight a horde of demons once more while Noctis races to the crystal. Except this time, it’s high stakes due to Cor being too injured to fight, so Prompto protects him with everything he has while Gladiolus and Ravus fight with all of their might. Realizing that keeping Cor around might lead to their deaths, Ravus orders Gladiolus, Prompto and Cor to escape while he holds off the demons. Gladiolus asks him if he’s crazy, but Ravus replies that he’s now willing to do anything to keep the king safe, and that Gladiolus should do the same. They flee while watching Ravus go out in a blaze of glory in the name of his pride, his king and for Tenebrae. Timeskip happens, but Cor is more of a mentor than an active participant due to his injuries and teaches Gladiolus and Prompto how to survive. Gladiolus decides that after what Cor and Ravus did for Noctis, it’s his time to step up and truly show if he’s worthy for the title of King’s shield. Cor understands this, and hands Gladiolus his sword while Gladiolus goes to complete the Bladekeeper’s Trial. Gilgamesh would be yet another character to taunt Gladiolus of his failures, except Gladiolus is reminded of how much Cor and Ravus put on the line for Noctis so he moves forward, regardless of what may come. Gilgamesh is impressed at his resolve and dares Gladiolus to come seek glory. Gladiolus completes the Bladekeeper’s Trial and reports to Cor. Cor is proud that Gladiolus was able to do what Clarus could not, and tells Gladiolus that he can keep both of his swords as he won’t be needing them anymore. The rest would be up to Gladiolus. Noctis awakens, meets Gladiolus and Prompto before speaking to Cor at Hammerhead. Noctis thanks Cor for everything he’s done, but Cor nods and says that he should really thank the two behind him. The trio then progress to Insomnia. Along the way, Noctis thinks about everything that happened and swears not to let Lunafreya and Ravus dying be in vain. Before heading up to confront Ardyn once and for all, Noctis stops Gladiolus and Prompto and tells them that they mean more to him than they could know. Gladiolus and Prompto respond by looking at Noctis and laughing hysterically, saying that he’s certainly grown the past 10 years. Noctis counters by saying the same about Prompto, to which Prompto retorts that he couldn’t be the one left behind while everyone else was fighting. Gladiolus then gives Noctis Cor’s sword, and says to give one to Ardyn on his behalf. Noctis dies, the sun rises up once more. Gladiolus and Prompto watch as Prompto tries his best not to break down, along with Gladiolus. Ravus is seen smiling and wishing Lunafreya the best while the sun rises again over Tenebrae.

During the events of Episode Ignis, Gladiolus would be doing his own thing similar to how Ignis was fending off Niflheim. Except he would arrive too late to see Ignis and Noctis injured. Because of his minor relation to Ignis and Gladiolus, I could see Ravus accompanying the group this time around to Gralea instead of traveling by himself. Noctis and Gladiolus duke it out again, except it’s almost physical this time because of how hard all three of them fought in Altissia only to lose so much. Because of this, Gladiolus becomes even more serious from this point onward and with Ignis being blind, I could also see the group splitting up for various reasons. One that stands out the most would be Noctis’ distrust of Ravus even though Ravus had a change of heart but Ignis defends Ravus. So while the group would still be tense because of Ignis’ injury and Ravus’ entry, they would eventually work past their differences and vow to fulfill the prophecy. At this point, Gladiolus and Ravus would also develop respect for one another. On the ride to Tenebrae, Ardyn would probably kidnap Ignis to force Noctis to come to Gralea (which is technically what happened in Episode Ignis, Verse 2 as Ardyn wanted a reason to force Noctis to ascend). Ravus would then explain what happened to the capital and because of his knowledge, he would lead the group to a faster way to Ignis. Once Ignis is rescued, they would fend off demons once more while Noctis heads for the crystal. In this instance, the Emperor would be among that horde wanting to slay Gladiolus, Ignis and Ravus trying to stop Noctis. When the timeskip happens, Ignis and Ravus discuss what Tenebrae was like before Niflheim took over, and Ravus wishes to see the sun rise over it again. Because no one stopped Verstael 10 years ago, Ardyn would have had a corrupted version of Immortalis waiting for the trio and Noctis would’ve had to use the might of the Six to stop it. After it’s defeated, Ravus joins once more to help Noctis fulfill his calling. While in Insomnia, Ravus apologizes to Noctis for the destruction of his homeland and Noctis ignores it, likely saying that Tenebrae fell before it and none of his ancestors were able to stop it. With this in mind, he has the vow of opening up Lucis to all, regardless of birth or circumstances. Ardyn at this point would likely toy with Gladiolus, Ignis and Ravus to enrage Noctis before fighting him. Ardyn is defeated, and before Noctis dies he would thank Gladiolus and Ignis for always having his back even at the worst times and promises to keep Luna happy for Ravus. Noctis dies, and the remaining group watches the sun rise once more. I wouldn’t find this a very tragic ending as opposed to Gladiolus not being there, if only because all three of them would live (in my opinion) and while you do lose out on the value of photos, you could at least recall the events that led up to that point. Assuming Ardyn would make use of Immortalis, he would also threat what little outposts were left to use against Noctis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignis:&lt;/strong&gt; and finally, without Ignis the group would change completely. It would be more of a “my best friends and I” feel because there’s no one to constantly remind them of their duty and Gladiolus did want to see what life was like beyond Insomnia. I get a strong feeling that it would be more of a comedy between all three, fun for everyone. It wouldn’t be all fun and games though, since they would struggle immensely. For one, as far as I know Ignis is the only one that can cook. They would struggle with camping, so I could see them trying to replicate a few Hunter recipes to get them by or Cup Noodles. Another reason would be that Noctis has a history of being a bad driver at times, so they would have to cover for expenses if they weren’t careful enough. With no one to manage expenses either, I could also see Noctis and Prompto going crazy with money until Gladiolus puts a stop to it (or vice versa if Gladiolus sees something he wants but doesn’t need). While Gladiolus and Prompto give Noctis strategies, it probably wouldn’t be as effective if one was advised by Ignis. However, Gladiolus knows the lay of the land so he would probably take over for Ignis when it comes to knowing when or how to attack an enemy. As for breaking into strongholds, I could see them enlisting the help of the hunters should things go south while Noctis tries to scout for any threats while infiltrating. Speaking of infiltrating, when Ravus shows up Gladiolus still loses yet again, but in this scenario I would imagine that he doesn’t leave on his journey because leaving Noctis and Prompto on their own is dangerous. It’s because of this that he goes from being a jokester to being frustrated, paranoid and serious that he can’t do his job properly. From here on out, he swears that he’ll never fall to his knees again. So while Noctis and Prompto deal with Gladiolus’ change in personality, they would all head to get Mythril while Aranea pokes fun at Gladiolus. When they acquire Mythril, they ask if she wants to be part of the crew, but she would retort that they wouldn’t have enough money to ever hire her. Before they set sail to Altissia, Cor would apologize as he always does except he notices something off about Gladiolus. So in return, he accompanies them to Altissia. Along the way, Noctis and Prompto are doing their own thing while trying to get used to the serious tone and someone even more serious. Cor would advise Gladiolus to not get hung up on his past failures and to keep moving forward. When they arrive, there would be little time for sightseeing as Cor reminds Noctis that Luna is in town, preparing for the covenant with Leviathan. Noctis would ignore this and hope to see Luna again. The rite happens again, except Cor takes the role of Ignis in Episode Ignis. He would spend time fending off Niflheim while Gladiolus and Prompto evacuate the citizens. Cor would then encounter Ravus, who shows visible anger towards Cor, but Cor also sees that it’s not him that Ravus is after. The two decide to have an uneasy alliance since Cor swore to protect the king. The bickering is also the same, except Cor reminding Ravus to stay focused on his goal. Since Ravus has no respect for Cor like he did Ignis, he would be much more angry at Luna’s death, resulting in a fierce battle between him and Cor with Cor eventually gaining the upper hand at the cost of being exhausted. Ardyn shows up once more to subdue both him and Ravus. Instead of trying to take someone immediately to Gralea to force Noctis to ascend, Ardyn would toy with Cor specifically to see if his moniker (the Immortal) holds weight to his name. Ardyn duels with Cor, easily gaining the upper hand due to his demonic powers. Ravus steps in but even after catching Ardyn off guard Ardyn quickly disposes of him as well. Just before Ardyn seems to land what would be a fatal blow on Noctis, Cor unleashes the last of his strength to take the hit, leaving a massive wound on his &lt;em&gt;back.&lt;/em&gt; Gladiolus and Prompto finally show up to see Ravus sprawled out and Ardyn ordering imperial soldiers to take Cor instead to Gralea. From here on out is when things get stressful for the group. Gladiolus, ashamed for not being able to protect Noctis for a second time and with not much to show for it (aside from evacuating the citizens) tries as best as he can to muster up composure and to get Noctis to go to Gralea while trying to get over Luna’s death. He would tell Noctis that the past already happened, but Noctis would take it personal and call out Gladiolus for acting weird ever since he lost to Ravus. Gladiolus moves in to strike Noctis but Prompto intervenes and takes the blow instead. Gladiolus is shocked and tries to help Prompto, but Prompto says it’s ok and reminds them that they can’t stop now since Cor was captured. Gladiolus storms off because of Noctis and Noctis tries to help Prompto. On the train ride, Prompto comforts Noctis about Luna’s death and reveals to him what happened in his childhood involving him and Pryna. He also mentions to Noctis to try and not take it so personal with Gladiolus, because he’s also been trying his best. After receiving Katana of the Warrior, things are still tense between the two but they both look at each other and agree to move forward, for now. Meanwhile, Ardyn is having fun torturing Cor to see if Cor is as tough as they say. During this, he also questions Cor’s unwavering loyalty and taunts him about failing to protect Regis. Cor looks at him and says he managed to protect what the king wanted safe, angering Ardyn. Ardyn leaves Cor to rot while he prepares for the arrival of Noctis. Same scenario plays out but in this instance Ardyn wouldn’t give Gladiolus or Prompto their weapons back, taunting them about being too incapable to help Noctis. Along the way, Noctis gets ambushed by the Emperor and is forced to flee. Right as he’s back into a corner, he suddenly regains use of his powers again. He fends off the Emperor until it’s cut down by someone else: Ravus. As it turns out, Ravus was the one that disabled the machine preventing the three from summoning weapons. From this point on, Ravus assists Noctis in trying to help find Cor and getting to the crystal. Eventually, they would meet up with Gladiolus and Prompto and make their way to Cor. When they locate Cor, they find him strung up along with cuts and bruises all over his upper body. Horrified, Noctis frees him and asks if he’s still ok. Cor says he’s fine and is glad that Noctis is still ok. Gladiolus at this point finally loses it and breaks down in anger at the sight of Cor, wondering if he’s really worthy of being the King’s Shield. Cor chastises him, and said that so long as Noctis was still breathing he was still worthy of his duty. Ravus, impressed by the devotion of these men, tells Noctis that their sacrifices should not be in vain and hands him Regis’ sword. Noctis then vows to stop Ardyn. They make their way to the crystal, where they fight a horde of demons once more while Noctis races to the crystal. Except this time, it’s high stakes due to Cor being too injured to fight, so Prompto protects him with everything he has while Gladiolus and Ravus fight with all of their might. Realizing that keeping Cor around might lead to their deaths, Ravus orders Gladiolus, Prompto and Cor to escape while he holds off the demons. Gladiolus asks him if he’s crazy, but Ravus replies that he’s now willing to do anything to keep the king safe, and that Gladiolus should do the same. They flee while watching Ravus go out in a blaze of glory in the name of his pride, his king and for Tenebrae. Timeskip happens, but Cor is more of a mentor than an active participant due to his injuries and teaches Gladiolus and Prompto how to survive. Gladiolus decides that after what Cor and Ravus did for Noctis, it’s his time to step up and truly show if he’s worthy for the title of King’s shield. Cor understands this, and hands Gladiolus his sword while Gladiolus goes to complete the Bladekeeper’s Trial. Gilgamesh would be yet another character to taunt Gladiolus of his failures, except Gladiolus is reminded of how much Cor and Ravus put on the line for Noctis so he moves forward, regardless of what may come. Gilgamesh is impressed at his resolve and dares Gladiolus to come seek glory. Gladiolus completes the Bladekeeper’s Trial and reports to Cor. Cor is proud that Gladiolus was able to do what Clarus could not, and tells Gladiolus that he can keep both of his swords as he won’t be needing them anymore. The rest would be up to Gladiolus. Noctis awakens, meets Gladiolus and Prompto before speaking to Cor at Hammerhead. Noctis thanks Cor for everything he’s done, but Cor nods and says that he should really thank the two behind him. The trio then progress to Insomnia. Along the way, Noctis thinks about everything that happened and swears not to let Lunafreya and Ravus dying be in vain. Before heading up to confront Ardyn once and for all, Noctis stops Gladiolus and Prompto and tells them that they mean more to him than they could know. Gladiolus and Prompto respond by looking at Noctis and laughing hysterically, saying that he’s certainly grown the past 10 years. Noctis counters by saying the same about Prompto, to which Prompto retorts that he couldn’t be the one left behind while everyone else was fighting. Gladiolus then gives Noctis Cor’s sword, and says to give one to Ardyn on his behalf. Noctis dies, the sun rises up once more. Gladiolus and Prompto watch as Prompto tries his best not to break down, along with Gladiolus. Ravus is seen smiling and wishing Lunafreya the best while the sun rises again over Tenebrae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you think? Agree or disagree? If the latter, how do you think it would play out? Would it end prematurely?&lt;/p&gt;

680,,FFXV,"My PS4 copy was stolen about a year ago and I'm really itching to replay. I have a PS4 Pro hooked up to a 4k tv with HDR (FF15 was actually why I upgraded to the pro) and I remember the performance was actually pretty respectable apart from the frame pacing. 

Conversely, my PC currently has a GTX 970 with 8gb ram hooked up to a 1440p monitor.

I'm trying to play with Japanese VA and Spanish text/subtitles. Is that doable with both versions?

Is there any kind of mod scene for the PC version that might tip the scales toward that version?

I remember when the game first came out, the combat kind of threw me off. I was expecting a proper action-style combat system instead of the hold-the-button-down-to-countinously-attack thing. Did they ever add an option to turn off the auto-attacking and dodging?

686,,FFXV,"1. I just rewatched Kingsglaive after finishing the main game, and now knowing that Clarus was Gladio’s dad, I’m wondering something. On the day that Insomnia fell, Gladio lost his dad too, not just Noctis. And I’m sure Ignis had family in the city, too, but we know specifically that Clarus died while protecting the king. So why is it not mentioned after the gang learns about the city falling? Noctis mourns his dad’s death and the other guys support him, but no one says anything about Gladio’s dad dying. I find it odd that the devs didn’t include any dialogue mentioning it, not even just a couple lines.

2. The Empire worked so hard to fell Insomnia, so why did they leave it unoccupied afterwards? It’s a massive city with expansive resources, I don’t understand why they would destroy the city and then abandon it, instead of taking it over and the surrounding territories and expanding Niflheim’s rule.

3. In the end fight scene when Libertus drives away and Nyx is riding on the shoulder of one of the old kings, is it Regis? I tried to determine which royal arm he was wielding but I couldn’t distinguish it.

4. I’m a little disappointed that Libertus didn’t make any kind of appearance in the main game. Other than Luna, he was the only other main character that survived, so I figured he would have made some kind of appearance. Even Nyx was seen, granted it was his body hanging in the throne room along with Regis and Luna in chapter 14.

5. Not a question, but I noticed that both the movie and the main game ended with the sun rising at dawn after someone’s sacrifice.

705,,FFXV,"so first of all i love FFXV, along with VII, its probably my favorite game of all time, this is not bashing on XV!

people say its unfinished, i never felt that.. for me it felt more like it was being mysterious and like the story we got in the game was part of a bigger story that we were not supposed to know.. its unconventional but it worked for me, i think it actually added to my enjoyment of the game

But logically it is quite obvious that there is something missing, i have suspected that one big story line was cut for some reason and they didn't have time to replace it and that's why the game is clunky at parts.

and i think i have figured out what that was -the Moon-

we all know that the instead of just nights getting longer and longer throughout the story the moon would also get bigger and we have seen those nice shots from old trailers where the moon is real big and the sky glows red, and it looks so cool, i always wondered why it was changed..i think i have figured it out also :P

you know how Tabata said that the game was pretty much done in interviews from early 16' ? and then the reason it got delayed was because they couldn't get certain parts to run on the ps4 without it crashing? most notably the leviathan fight.... i think the Moon mechanic was one of the things that would crash the game, so it had to be cut for that reason... i have read in datamined text that the moon would play a part in the story, namely the moon was gonna charge the ring! not the crystal..the big red scary moon was gonna charge the ring! Noct was gonna be imprisoned on Anglagard for 10 years while the moon got absorbed, for 2 whole chapters he was gonna be on Anglagard.

this is what the chapter description said:chapter 13, Angelgard: after he thought his body had been melted in to the crystal, noct find himself alone, locked up in an unknown space/room, surrounding him are the ""phantom swords"" he has collected so far, he can't feel the presence of the daemons. he doesn't know what happend to the imperial capital he had just been in, or what happend to his friends, he's going mad with impatiens/ restlessness.

and chapter 14: still on angelgard, the island is protected by the ""power of the star"" so powerful that the daemons and Ardyn can't get there, noct absorbs the last rays of the moon in to the ring and hopes the world and his friends are safe, when the moon is almost gone he hears a voice ""the time has come"" and the door appears. when noct has fully absorbed the power of the star and can leave the prison ,10 years has passed.

(i think what is chapter 13 now would have been chapter 12 btw)

i think this is really interesting especially considering that other than chapter 13-14 (when Noctis is imprisoned) everything plays ut pretty much the same... i have heard before that there had to be story changes after production on Kingsglaive was complete and that's why there are inconsistencies..i think all of that was tied to the moon, and the crystal was obviously supposed to be a dark crystal, and the Lucis magic was obviously supposed to be dark magic, but when they couldn't make the moon thing work, they changed the crystal to a crystal of light and don't really talk much about it....

so thats my hot take.. FFXV being weird is not because of censoring, or crappy directors(they both did good) its because of over ambitious mechanics that did not run properly!

let's hope they recycle some of it for FFXVI

cheers!

I’m not exactly *good* at battling, basically can’t dodge or parry very well so I always take a lot of damage in every fight. Hence why I played the main game on easy difficulty most of the time. So I’m worried about actually being able to progress in the game as I’ve heard the quests and bosses are quite difficult and require a lot of grinding and help from other players (apparently the AI’s aren’t very helpful?).

I’ve heard that most of the servers are dead. I don’t particularly like playing games with other people anyway since I’m not very good at any kind of battling and end up slowing people down and getting beat on for it (plus I’m a girl so that never goes over great on online servers). Even though I’m not a skilled player, I still play because I love games and their stories and characters, so I really want to play Comrades to fill in the story gap.

725,,FFXV,"I am posting this since after doing quite a lot of searching I couldn't find too many posts on that, especially trustworthy ones.

While using this step sequence, I managed to farm 12 of them in roughly one day:

TIME: Post game. 

Although MA-X Angelus-0's start spawning as soon as Chapter 3(yes, I encountered one myself through spending hours doing hunts, sidequests and reaching lvl99), you cannot start farming the V2 until you receive the Ring of Lucis in Chapter 13. You can start farming it a bit earlier as soon as you can call Umbra again, but it's better to finish the story because then you have longer days, that makes it easier for you to notice...stuff.

OPERATING SYSTEM: Playstation 4 Pro

METHOD: Alterna(Ring of the Lucii). 

Fastest way to farm the accessories by all means. However you want to actually KILL MA-X Angelus-0 is entirely up to you.

PLACE: Water tower near the Cotisse Haven, North of Hammerhead. 

Probably any place that has a nearby haven and spawns MA-X Angelus-0 works, but that's the one I was using.

KEY EQUIPMENT: Ring of Lucis, Key of Prosperity.

Most important equipment besides the Ring of Lucis is the Key of Prosperity accessory which I think you can only receive through the Holiday Pack+ add-on/dlc. I strongly believe the item drop success rate also adds to the rare item drop success rate as well.

DISH: Papa bird &amp; baby bowl.

This dish doubles your item drop success rate. As I said above, I strongly believe the item drop success rate involves the rare item chances as well. If it wasn't, I really wouldn't have collected 12 V2s in 10-12 total game hours. Anyway, although I'm not sure how much % the Key of prosperity actually adds to the already default 5% rare item drop (info from FANDOM) but I think it's something 1%-5% with 5% being unlikely but possible, the success rate doubled from the food buff would be at least 10%+KoP% or even 10%+KoP%*2 if the food buff doubles the total rate which could possibly go up to a total 20%.

SPAWNING MA-X ANGELUS-0:

1. Camp and the haven and select Papa bird &amp; baby bowl.
2. Head to the water tower.
3. Clear the area of Sabertusks.
4. Wait for the Imperial ship to come. Should be in mere seconds after you clear the area. 
5. Check. If it is Ma-X Angelus-0 - kill it and save asap. If it's not Ma-X Angelus-0 - save before the fight starts. 
6. In both occasions from step 4 - load the same file right after you save it. You can use either your main game file or create a new one.

Repeat steps 3-6 untill midnight comes (exactly 0000 or 2400) because that's when the ships stop coming and daemons start spawning in your area. Only ship that now comes is Aranea's. Then you can just use the map option to return to last place rested and rest until morning, then head beck to the tower and continue. Check your food buff also. If it's about to finish, then repeat steps 1-6.

Happy farming!

OTHER INFORMATION:

Although I didn't go into depth with this one, but probably you should make your group as tanky as possible, since Alterna's success rate is not 100% and I sincerely doubt the Magic stat has any infuence on that. During my encounters it was 50/50 that I could kill MA-X Angelus-0 in one try. If it does not work the 1st time then you will have to use it 2, 3 or even sometimes more than 10 times before it finally dies. So, the more alive members in your group, the more chance Noctis won't be targeted. And it is advisable to tank up Noctis as well so you wouldn't fall to Danger state too often.

Since you cannot influence the loading screen, the only two things that you actually can influence is how fast you will notice what's in the ship, save and load, and how fast you can take out the Final Fantasy's own freakin' Megatron(it makes that sound similar to transformers):

You can stock up on Ethers for just 100 gil each from:

Shop: House of Hexes, JM Market - Altissia, Cartanica, Tenebrae, Zegnautus Keep, Hammerhead [Ch.14], Kingsglaive Base Camp, Regalia Shop (Copied from FANDOM)

I suggest using Ethers since by the time you start farming V2's you will have accumulated a considerable amount of gil, so spending 10-20k will save you from looking for the right camera angle or even running around looking for a warp spot that you can't even see because of Alterna's visual effects.

It's best to stay near or even under MA-X Angelus-0 to avoid it firing it's rocket launcher that's impossible to ******* dodge. 

AND it's best to cast Alterna in mid-air to avoid the left arm's aoe ground attack. Although it still leaves you open for both arms' physical attack a moment before their weapons are used. Watch out for that too.

Also, it gets harder to notice what's in the ship once evening comes, so you might want to consider returning to rest point earlier before it becomes completely dark. Unless, of course, it doesn't bother you and you don't give a **** about your health.

IMPORTANT!!!

There have been some discussions on MA-X Angelus-0 RNG's spawn predictions, so here's my 2 cents:

Loading the same game file doesn't reset the RNG - saving does. Once you overwrite the file it resets the RNG and once you load it again, there are 3 spawning possibilities - 10 Magitek Assassins, MA Veles-bis with a few troops, and MA-X Angelus-0. So basically that makes it roughly a 33% chance that Angelus will spawn and that is why some people claim that they spawned one after another. My best run was 4 in a row and 1 after that. I actually managed to get 2 V2s during that run. So it's actually safe to assume that waiting for Angelus to spawn without using the save/load method will take you a lot longer.

Also! While using the method in this post at some  point I stopped spawning Angelus and got more random encounters such as Bannermen instead. It didn't feel like I did something completely out of the ordinary, but something still went wrong. Since it happen only once, I cannot tell much more because I solved it pretty fast by just killing the troops with Fire all of them at once and just saved/loaded - same just like having Angelus spawned. After that it was fixed and I stopped farming once I got my 12th Magitek Suit V2.

LASTLY! Although being a really good method to acquire V2's, it is still quite a long and demanding challenge to farm them. I would suggest taking short breaks while the game is loading like drinking some water, eating a cookie, reading an article, simply checking up something or doing small chores. That way the process won't be as monotonous and it will prevent you from getting too tired or simply falling to a psychological state that makes you completely lose your fun with the game.


WELL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THAT. Feel free to comment your thoughts. Hopefully people will try this method and also on different platforms. Please comment feedback here.

Once you overwrite the file it resets the RNG and once you load it again, there are 3 spawning possibilities - 10 Magitek Assassins, MA Veles-bis with a few troops, and MA-X Angelus-0. So basically that makes it roughly a 33% chance that Angelus will spawn and that is why some people claim that they spawned one after another. My best run was 4 in a row and 1 after that. I actually managed to get 2 V2s during that run. So it&amp;#39;s actually safe to assume that waiting for Angelus to spawn without using the save/load method will take you a lot longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also! While using the method in this post at some  point I stopped spawning Angelus and got more random encounters such as Bannermen instead. It didn&amp;#39;t feel like I did something completely out of the ordinary, but something still went wrong. Since it happen only once, I cannot tell much more because I solved it pretty fast by just killing the troops with Fire all of them at once and just saved/loaded - same just like having Angelus spawned. After that it was fixed and I stopped farming once I got my 12th Magitek Suit V2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LASTLY! Although being a really good method to acquire V2&amp;#39;s, it is still quite a long and demanding challenge to farm them. I would suggest taking short breaks while the game is loading like drinking some water, eating a cookie, reading an article, simply checking up something or doing small chores. That way the process won&amp;#39;t be as monotonous and it will prevent you from getting too tired or simply falling to a psychological state that makes you completely lose your fun with the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WELL, THAT&amp;#39;S PRETTY MUCH THAT. Feel free to comment your thoughts. Hopefully people will try this method and also on different platforms. Please comment feedback here. I apologise in advance if smething similar was covered in the past. GOOD LUCK!&lt;/p&gt;

1) is there a definite place to buy it? Which platform should I go for? If they're all the same, I'd definitely prefer to have it on Steam.

2) when I beat it, episode Ardyn wasn't out. When is the best time to play episode Ardyn? I know the optimal times to play the other 3 episodes but episode Ardyn is lost on me.

It’s not that fps goes down according to the readings it just freezes and then it’s smooth again for maybe a second then freezes again. All the time during the fight and it’s getting me killed. Any ideas on what I can do to solve this?

If you are of the extreme minority who own the game on Xbox One and buy an additional copy for PC on the Microsoft Store, you will find that game saves are shared between the two. Of more interesting benefit is that you can share saves regardless of what DLC you have purchased on Xbox One; despite the PC version coming with all DLC sans Episode Ardyn, progress on the PC version's DLC is gracefully and seamlessly ignored on this save data if you skip back to playing on Xbone without having purchased the requisite DLC. This is very good to know for the extreme minority of people like me who keep multiple versions of the game (personally, PS4 Pro at 1.00/no DLC for best day one experience, Xbox One X with all DLC except Royal for best vanilla experience, PC with ALL the things) and take issue with the horrible state of the Steam version.

771,,FFXV,"From all my time in the game, i've noticed Armiger Warpstrike is 100% legit trash.

It takes pretty long. But the damage is absolutely pathetic. Meanwhile just ""holding O"" in Armiger will do WAY and i mean WAY more damage and it will also gapclose way faster. There is no reason to use Armiger Warpstrike over ""holding O"" while in Armiger mode as far as i know.

This seems to be because Armiger Warpstrike is always only a 1.0x damage multiplier.

However… In the clip i posted below. For some reason. I suddenly get a proper Warpstrike 2.4x Multiplier while in Armiger. And my target actually dies in one hit... The Second target gets the typical 1.0x and doesn't die in one hit... again proving how bad Armiger Warpstrike really is.

In the second clip, i'm pretty far away from the target yet only get a 1.0x multiplier.

I feel like Armiger Warpstrike would actually be useful and damaging if it would get the proper multiplier based on distance. But it doesn't… So it sux.

But my question is. Why am i actually getting a multiplier in that first clip? What's the trick? What am i missing?

PS: if you don't believe Armiger Warpstrike is trash, notice in the second clip i only shave off 10% of a trooper's HP but then i hold O for like half a second and already do 40% HP on another target...

778,,FFXV,"I know this hasn't been too much of a debate singe the FFXIV event dropped, giving us the new handgun, Abandon of the Vortex, and it's good and all, but I think his best handgun is really debatable. Between Abandon of the Vortex and Death Penalty, the power difference, including strength bonus, is 6 towards Abandon of the Vortex, a very small number. It gets an increased appendage breaking advantage, which is a small niche. Otherwise, the +50% vulnerable damage is nice, but given the AI of this game, I find it won't be too useful too often. On the other hand, Death Penalty has a 1% chance to inflict Instant Death, which certainly is a small chance. But for similar damage when given the Critical Hit food (sushi), I think that Death Penalty is likely easily far better when against enemies that are susceptible to Instant Death. But when not susceptible, or when not using the Critical Hit food (sushi), it goes back to Abandon of the Vortex. 

I know this is a very small, niche topic to discuss when it's for the Handgun, used by a character that, when you control, isn't going to be using the Handgun much at all, but since I've seen people claim that Abandon of the Vortex is Prompto's best Handgun, I just thought I'd give my input.

I'm lvl 99 and have 61hours of gameplay. Completed all other trophies including 999,999kw and I'm yet to see the owner of Kenny's diner.

The Oracle Lunafreya, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;upon awakening from the slumber of death, discovers that her body has undergone an extraordinary transformation&lt;/span&gt;.

828,,FFXV,"Hi All,

Just wanted to share my observations from a person who has never played any FF games or even been exposed to it.  I am considered at least middle age and I have never enjoyed single player RPG's before, tried many including fallout etc.

I have to say, this one is different.  I have owned it since release, played it maybe 10 minutes on release and just shelved it (windows version)  I have been playing it the last few days and it's really been a joy.

1. The scale and scope of the detailed world is astonishing.  I am a software developer and have been over 30 years.  The level of work in this thing is just amazing to me. 

2. The interactions and story and work among the group is fun and doesn't get old or tired.  So many RPG's and JRPG's that I have tried are repetitive and annoying.  They mix it up well and make it fun and you end up caring about the story and the characters in your group and frankly I have a terrible imagination and still loved it.

3. The depth of the game, I am on chapter 3 but I have gone back to 1 and 2 areas and had fun and am level 21 already because I wanted to do more there with customizing the car and other things.

Just a really fun experience for a guy that has not had much enjoyment with single player RPG's in the past.  I'd highly recommend more than a cursory glance if you are like me and just never really liked them.

I am actually typing this while I wait for Windows 10 to finish installing onto my USB pen drive to fully format my PC.  
I have constant grey screen crashes, black screen crashes, and just out of the blue normal crash to desktop crashes.

For crying out loud, I'm having crashes every 2 minutes of starting a load...   
I've tried DDUing my GPU drivers (in safe mode ofc.); reinstalling the GPU drivers; turning off Ansel - I literally deleted the gods damned folder from the drive to be sure -; forced windows to update (I always set it up to only download updated after the maximum amount of time, like 6 months or something; Tried borderless window, fullscreen, even windowed mode  both on the .ini file and ingame; max settings and low settings; all nvidia shit on AND off; V sync on and off...

I give up. No other game has been this frustrating to me. The annoying part is that I was actually having fun - But for some reason ever since I reached Zegnautus this has become unbearable...

BRB, formating this piece of shit windows...

And as the DLCs rolled out I was playing them as soon as I possible could up until the end when graduating college got in the way.

But I feel like a lot of it felt super distracting from the ending. Like at long last after 10 years of gathering providence let me do some photo quests and hunt down some mini enemy bases. And I get they were trying to tie comrades into the main game but honestly the whole glaive thing and the Cor thing felt super weird.

904,,FFXV,"Yesterday I opened a thread where I explained that I have created a fan page for Final Fantasy XV, where there are two projects for FF15. The first project was a translated version of ""Parting Ways"" in German. Shortly thereafter, I was informed that there is already an official German version. Shame about my time.

The second project is the ""Archive Project."" There are countless collateral materials to Final Fantasy XV. From anime about a movie and spin-off games. And anyone who knows Square knows that it is not certain that this content will always be available.

As an example we would have the two mobile games ""Justice Monsters Five"" and ""King's Knight"". Both can now no longer be played on mobile and the former is only available in the main game at vending machines. That's why the Archive-project was launched.

The goal is to retain as many relevant side-material as possible, to allow players to have the fullest possible experience with Final Fantasy XV.

To put it directly: The archived materials were all obtained legally and in compliance with the (German) law. We are non-commercial and have no personal benefits from this project. We do it all in our free time. We will also post our backups on our website only if certain media are no longer available on official channels (Youtube-Chanel, official websites, etc.) and / or require an absurd price to procure official copies.

As I said. Our goal is to keep future games of Final Fantasy XV open at all times to provide the most complete experience possible.

At the moment we have the following archived both digitally and physically:

Chapter 13 especially sucked. Running down corridors and unlocking doors and turning on power for 30 minutes while Ayrden? tells you that you’re powerless while destroying deamons was the worst thing, (besides the shit boss fight with leviathan) that i’ve ever had to do in a video game on PS4.

None of the pre-rendered ‘movie cutscences had any volume at all. The story was awful. The ’skills’ were irrelevent. 

Literally the only cool thing were the Gods and riding Chocobos. 

the sidequests and hunts were terrible. The ‘love interest’ with Luna’s death was the most unearned emotion in a final fantasy game. Alot of the English Dub was just terrible and awkward.

920,,FFXV,"The only online English translation of the lyrics to this song is a reddit post from a year or so back, and the translation is, to put it nicely, not entirely accurate. Please don't take this as me dumping on OP! Latin is a really difficult language even when written correctly, which the lyrics to this song definitely are not. But it's been bugging me for over a year now, so I finally decided to sit down and put my Latin degree to use.


&amp;nbsp;


This probably isn't 100% accurate either - like I said, the original Latin is dodgy, so there was a lot of having to guess what the author might have *intended* to write rather than translating the grammatical nonsense that they actually wrote. But this is definitely a lot more accurate than the previous translation.


&amp;nbsp;


With your face toward me

all so greatly worship my flesh.

&amp;nbsp;


I am the one who throws stones

and steers all lives.

&amp;nbsp;


Heaven, Earth, turned away

And the great, the small, returned


&amp;nbsp;


As a mighty leader, I command

the light that you will bind with your voice.


&amp;nbsp;


When all is full of light

there will come the end of the Apocalypse.


&amp;nbsp;


Conquered will be the one that devoured

the lives of all here: the darkness.


&amp;nbsp;


Evil incarnate rises,

bringing with it death.

Prepare! Prepare! Prepare! Prepare!


&amp;nbsp;


The mighty king, warrior,

sword in hand.

A war in virtue

won over the enemy.


&amp;nbsp;


First comes death

which comes for a certain person.

All prepare! All prepare! All prepare!


&amp;nbsp;


This is the time,

this is the place

where we must make our stand,

all of us at last, every last one of us!

&lt;p&gt;And the great, the small, returned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mighty leader, I command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the light that you will bind with your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all is full of light&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there will come the end of the Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conquered will be the one that devoured&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the lives of all here: the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evil incarnate rises,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bringing with it death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare! Prepare! Prepare! Prepare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mighty king, warrior,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sword in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war in virtue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;won over the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First comes death&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which comes for a certain person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All prepare! All prepare! All prepare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is the place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where we must make our stand,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all of us at last, every last one of us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us!&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds just a wee bit off, like his original English VA's accent, but seemingly wasn't re-recorded with the proper accent. I think it was a post-battle dialogue or idle dialogue from Altissia, but I'm at a loss and can't find it no matter what I Google. I haven't been able to trigger it in game, either.

I find the system cool to equip a different weapon for each attack style, but manually chossing is just better. 

What I really would have loved in the full game would be thr weapon skills you activate with the triangle button. Thats was certainly cool! 
But the final game is just better of course.

Although I have to say, that some interactions between the Chocobros feel even more dynamic than in the full game (like preset tactics before a fight).

&lt;p&gt;A volume of all-new, character-driven stories expanding on the world of the hit video game Final Fantasy XV. This deluxe, hardcover edition includes full-color inserts featuring concept art and exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To oppose the gods or yield to fate? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the question confronting each of the characters in The Dawn of the Future. Ardyn, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;having saved countless lives from the Starscourge, means to become the Founder King of Lucis and instead is cast into tragic exile&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;On the day the Empire falls, as the imperial capital collapses around them,&lt;/span&gt; Commodore Aranea is entrusted with the life of a singular young girl. The Oracle Lunafreya, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;upon awakening from the slumber of death,&lt;/span&gt; discovers that her body has undergone an extraordinary transformation. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;And after gazing upon the eternal,&lt;/span&gt; Noctis, the True King, finally comes to terms with his destiny. Herein lie the stories of the dawning of a new world in Final Fantasy XV.&lt;/p&gt;

968,,FFXV,"FFXV Windows Edition is the best version of FFXV to date, mainly because of this sweet, buttery-smooth framerates that you can get... on every store version except Steam. Due to the poor implementation of SteamAPI this version has the worst performance of all, getting stutters and framerate dips out of nowhere. Take a look at this:

Steam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6mBmdQMM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6mBmdQMM8)

Origin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJl7Zql5oE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJl7Zql5oE)

Microsoft Store: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wmOXWYP\_IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wmOXWYP_IQ)

I can confirm that this is a thing. There is one workaround, you can downgrade game manually to version 1.25 (the last stable Steam release), but doing that also disables some of additional content, including Episode Ardyn compatibility. Sure, you can blaze through the base game and three episodes on 1.25 and then update your game to play Ardyn, but... why bother if you have possibility to buy the game on other store and have zero problems with it? After playing FFXV on PS4 at launch I was eager to replay it on PC, bought the Steam version only to discover that it's stuttery mess. Bought again yesterday on Origin and man... the difference is real.
