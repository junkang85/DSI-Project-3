* **What is Final Fantasy XV?**

Final Fantasy XV (Japanese: ファイナルファンタジーXV; Simplified Chinese: 最终幻想15; Traditional Chinese: 最終幻想XV; stylized FINAL FANTASY XV; Final Fantasy 15 in some regions; abbreviated FFXV and FF15), the fifteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, follows Prince Noctis of Lucis and his three friends who must save the world of Eos by defeating the Niflheim Empire and purging darkness the plagues the ""star"" (another name for world).

Due to the scale of the game's narrative, the Final Fantasy XV project was split into several multi-media parts, dubbed the Final Fantasy XV Universe, to increase awareness of the game to different audiences.

* **Should I play Final Fantasy XV?**

The answer to this question is ultimately up to you. What some consider “good” might be others’ “bad,” and vice versa.

The game’s strengths lie in:

* the layered characterization.
* the themes of friendship, brotherhood, and accepting your duty with grace.
* the attention to “little things.”
* the freedom of choice in combat and exploration.
* the graphics.

However, some criticism includes:

* the implicit storytelling and unexplained events.
* the amount of research required to completely understand the story.
* the simplistic depictions of war, politics, and revenge.
* the linear final third of the game.
* the lack of forced difficulty.

We strongly recommend you form your own opinion!

* **What are all the pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The confirmed pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe are the works in the following table.

* **Do I need to play the DLCs, experience all of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, or play other Final Fantasy games?**

The DLCs and the Final Fantasy XV Universe is entirely optional. According to Tabata, their purpose is for a player to “get a better view of the world where the game is set.”  While each part of the Final Fantasy XV Universe is optional, “some fans who only see one part might be left with a negative impression, or like they've missed crucial parts of the tale.” You can play Final Fantasy XV without playing the DLCs or experiencing the Final Fantasy XV Universe, but you will need to pay more attention to context clues.

You do not need to play other Final Fantasy games in order to understand Final Fantasy XV. Each “numbered” Final Fantasy does not share a storyline with another. At most, playing other Final Fantasy games allow you to notice references and recurring themes.

* **What is the best order to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe?**

The crucial pieces of the Final Fantasy XV Universe, besides the main game itself, and other pieces are listed below. They are listed in the order in which they were released and include the approximate time they take place in the “timeline” (see “Which parts are ‘canon’?”). Use this information to determine when is the best time to experience the Final Fantasy XV Universe and related media.

1. Platinum Demo — 12 year before the beginning of the game.
2. Brotherhood — 15, 12, 8, and 5 years before the start of the game, and Chapters 1 through 3.
3. Kingsglaive — less than a year before the start of the game to the start of the game.
4. Prologue ~Parting Ways~ — the day before the start of the game.
5. Episode Gladiolus — during Chapter 7.
6. Episode Prompto — during Chapters 12 and 13.
7. Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades — between Chapters 13 and 14 and, for Future quests, Chapter 14.
8. Episode Ignis — during Chapters 9, 13, 14, and the end of the game.
9. Royal Pack — adds content throughout the entire game.
10. Episode Ardyn -Prologue- — &gt;!2,000!&lt; years before the beginning of the game and Chapter 14.
11. Episode Ardyn — &gt;!2,000!&lt;, &gt;!35!&lt;, and &gt;!22!&lt; years before and Chapter 14.

* **What are the upcoming DLC and updates for Final Fantasy XV?**

Development for Final Fantasy XV ended on March 25, 2019, with the release of Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn. The other three planned Dawn of the Future DLC—Episode Aranea, Episode Lunafreya, and Episode Noctis—have been canceled. However, a novelization of the Dawn of the Future DLC was released in Japan on April 25, 2019, and an English version will be coming *no earlier* than Fall 2019.

There are no updates planned for the main game or Final Fantasy XV Multiplayer (Expansion): Comrades because development has been ceased. However, there may still be small updates to the executable files. (This is not the same as a bug fix.)

* **What's up with the different versions of Comrades? Can I still get the Comrades DLC version trophies?**

Initially, Comrades was released as a DLC expansion launched through Final Fantasy XV called Multiplayer Expansion: Comrades. As of patch 1.27, the DLC expansion was moved to a standalone launcher on consoles called Multiplayer: Comrades. The PC version is the only platform that does not have a standalone launcher for Comrades.

After patch 1.27 on consoles, the DLC expansion's trophies are no longer obtainable. Furthermore, any trophies earned and any saves created on the DLC expansion will be transferred to the standalone version, although trophies may not activate until you unlock certain parts of the game. Finally, players can still access the DLC version to view previous photos and create characters for the &gt;!Chapter 14 cameo!&lt;; you cannot play missions on the DLC version.

* **Which version of Final Fantasy XV should I buy?**

Final Fantasy XV was released in many different editions. Please use [this table in our Wiki to view the differences between each edition’s content](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/console#wiki_difference_between_editions).

As a rule of thumb:

* If you do not have a copy of Final Fantasy XV, you should buy the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition for the PS4 or XB1 and the Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition for PC. These editions are a bundle of all of the 2016 to 2018 content; the 2019 content (Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn) has not been released as a cost-effective bundle.
* If you do have a copy of Final Fantasy XV for PS4 or XB1, wish to keep playing on PS4 or XB1, do not want the “bonus items”, and the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition is not on sale, it’s more cost-effective to buy the DLC individually.
* If you are considering whether to buy the Windows Edition, keep in mind that it is meant for high-end computers. Use the demo and benchmark tool to determine whether your system will run Final Fantasy XV to your satisfaction. Beware of late-game spoilers in the trailer at the end of the demo!
* Consider buying the game on sale. The base game and its bundles are often on sale for around 50% off.
* If you are buying a *used copy* Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition, make sure it comes with working codes. The DLC is not included on the disc.
* On console, the DLC region needs to match the base game region.

* **My game’s not working! How do I fix it?**

Please attempt some troubleshooting yourself by following [our Technical Support guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/tech_support) for consoles and PC before making a help post. If you're making a help post, be as specific as possible with your problem and attempts to fix it.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development for Final Fantasy XV ended on March 25, 2019, with the release of Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn. The other three planned Dawn of the Future DLC—Episode Aranea, Episode Lunafreya, and Episode Noctis—have been canceled. However, a novelization of the Dawn of the Future DLC was released in Japan on April 25, 2019, and an English version will be coming &lt;em&gt;no earlier&lt;/em&gt; than Fall 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s up with the different versions of Comrades? Can I still get the Comrades DLC version trophies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, Comrades was released as a DLC expansion launched through Final Fantasy XV called Multiplayer Expansion: Comrades. As of patch 1.27, the DLC expansion was moved to a standalone launcher on consoles called Multiplayer: Comrades. The PC version is the only platform that does not have a standalone launcher for Comrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After patch 1.27 on consoles, the DLC expansion&amp;#39;s trophies are no longer obtainable. Furthermore, any trophies earned and any saves created on the DLC expansion will be transferred to the standalone version, although trophies may not activate until you unlock certain parts of the game. Finally, players can still access the DLC version to view previous photos and create characters for the &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Chapter 14 cameo&lt;/span&gt;; you cannot play missions on the DLC version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which version of Final Fantasy XV should I buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy XV was released in many different editions. Please use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/console#wiki_difference_between_editions""&gt;this table in our Wiki to view the differences between each edition’s content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do not have a copy of Final Fantasy XV, you should buy the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition for the PS4 or XB1 and the Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition for PC. These editions are a bundle of all of the 2016 to 2018 content; the 2019 content (Final Fantasy XV: Episode Ardyn) has not been released as a cost-effective bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do have a copy of Final Fantasy XV for PS4 or XB1, wish to keep playing on PS4 or XB1, do not want the “bonus items”, and the Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition is not on sale, it’s more cost-effective to buy the DLC individually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are considering whether to buy the Windows Edition, keep in mind that it is meant for high-end computers. Use the demo and benchmark tool to determine whether your system will run Final Fantasy XV to your satisfaction. Beware of late-game spoilers in the trailer at the end of the demo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider buying the game on sale. The base game and its bundles are often on sale for around 50% off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are buying a &lt;em&gt;used copy&lt;/em&gt; Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition, make sure it comes with working codes. The DLC is not included on the disc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On console, the DLC region needs to match the base game region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My game’s not working! How do I fix it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please attempt some troubleshooting yourself by following &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/wiki/tech_support""&gt;our Technical Support guide&lt;/a&gt; for consoles and PC before making a help post. If you&amp;#39;re making a help post, be as specific as possible with your problem and attempts to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

11,,FFXV,"Salvete omnes!

I have, via contact with some Final Fantasy Distant Worlds folk, obtained the choral score to ""APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS"", and importantly, the lyrics. While they are in Latin, are really interesting, and written one who has studied ancient Roman culture and language. There is A LOT of specific religious imagery and allusions. At this time, I cannot provide a smooth translation (I should actually be studying for the Latin exam I have coming up...), but I will soon! And in the meantime, I'll post the lyrics, and my thoughts on what I gathered from site reading them.

&amp;#x200B;

**-During the Intro-**

Specie tua, tantum carnem adme omnes habet cultum

Ego sum qui mittit petras et gubernat omnes vitae.

Coelum\*, Terra, aversione. Magna, parvus, reversusque.

Fortis ductor, praecipio Quod ligabis lucem vobis.

**-Verse, after string melody-**

Cum omnibus lucis plenus, Apocalypse finibus

Victum unus qui comedit, Hic vitae omnia; tenebris

**-During oboe solo, choir is quiet-**

Malum incarnatus surgit, Adducentes secum mortem.

Para! Para! PARA! PARA!

**-After the Key Change, the women and men sing this next part in stretto (offset from each other)-**

Fortis Rex, Bellator, in manus gladio Bellum in virtute,

Victum quod hostibus. Para!

**-After the strings' and piano descending scale in octaves | More stretto between the women and men-**

Magis mortem venit primum. Quod est quidam venire.

Para omnes! Para omnes! Para omnes! *(the women sing ""Para omnes"" on offbeats while the men sing ""Para"" thrice across the whole stanza)*

**-Final stanza, the Big Finale-**

Nunc est tempus, Haec est locus Ubi nos obstandum, omne tandem ex nobis.

Unum! Omnes!

***-BIG G IN THE LOW BRASS AND STRINGS-***

\*Coelum is an alternate spelling of Caelum, which means sky/heaven. In Medieval Latin (which again, this is), that's the common spelling. It also helps to avoid confusing it with the Caelum family. In this case, coelum is  indeed just heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, we are being told the King, the True King, is the highest of them all. Both Heaven and Earth avert (Coelum, Terra, aversione) their gazes from him. He shines plenty of light, he's got a sword, he's really powerful, nothing compares. His arrival is the end. The Astrals (my interpretation) are telling you to prepare yourself (Para!) for the coming of True King. And once you've done that, go tell everyone else to prepare (Para omnes!). I'm not saying that the True King is God, since the writers stopped short of calling him that in the lyrics, but there is certainly a fair of... comparison to be made with a certain other ""King of Kings"".

Anyways, I'll update this post with a translation as soon as I can! If anyone else wants to tackle it, please by all means! Hope y'all can find some fun things in this!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I can't believe I didn't even translate the title. While it's probably obvious, I'll do it anyways. Says ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" or ""Noctis's Apocalypse"". I personally would go with the first one, since while Latin doesn't distinguish between something like ""The Apocalypse of Noctis"" and ""Noctis's Apocalypse"" in the genitive case like we would in English, the first one I find fits better aesthetically.

&lt;p&gt;Para omnes! Para omnes! Para omnes! &lt;em&gt;(the women sing &amp;quot;Para omnes&amp;quot; on offbeats while the men sing &amp;quot;Para&amp;quot; thrice across the whole stanza)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Final stanza, the Big Finale-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nunc est tempus, Haec est locus Ubi nos obstandum, omne tandem ex nobis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unum! Omnes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-BIG G IN THE LOW BRASS AND STRINGS-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Coelum is an alternate spelling of Caelum, which means sky/heaven. In Medieval Latin (which again, this is), that&amp;#39;s the common spelling. It also helps to avoid confusing it with the Caelum family. In this case, coelum is  indeed just heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, we are being told the King, the True King, is the highest of them all. Both Heaven and Earth avert (Coelum, Terra, aversione) their gazes from him. He shines plenty of light, he&amp;#39;s got a sword, he&amp;#39;s really powerful, nothing compares. His arrival is the end. The Astrals (my interpretation) are telling you to prepare yourself (Para!) for the coming of True King. And once you&amp;#39;ve done that, go tell everyone else to prepare (Para omnes!). I&amp;#39;m not saying that the True King is God, since the writers stopped short of calling him that in the lyrics, but there is certainly a fair of... comparison to be made with a certain other &amp;quot;King of Kings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;ll update this post with a translation as soon as I can! If anyone else wants to tackle it, please by all means! Hope y&amp;#39;all can find some fun things in this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I can&amp;#39;t believe I didn&amp;#39;t even translate the title. While it&amp;#39;s probably obvious, I&amp;#39;ll do it anyways. Says &amp;quot;The Apocalypse of Noctis&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Noctis&amp;#39;s Apocalypse&amp;quot;. I personally would go with the first one, since while Latin doesn&amp;#39;t distinguish between something like &amp;quot;The Apocalypse of Noctis&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Noctis&amp;#39;s Apocalypse&amp;quot; in the genitive case like we would in English, the first one I find fits better aesthetically. But either would be an acceptable translation.&lt;/p&gt;

39,,FFXV,"So, Gladio was meh. I dont really like his controls. And that extra final trial? No thank you. I have relied on potions, and I only get three? However, I was amused how his combat reminded me more of games like dmc or onimusha. The health bar not refilling and more emphasis on survival. I just enjoy being able to prepare...

However, I just got to prompto and... am I only one who thinks this is a fun change of pace?

Like, I actually enjoyed Dirge of Cerberus. I wont deny its faults. But it was still fun. This feels like a more involved version of that.

I love the different weapons, strategies, and how he just plays. I wouldnt actually mind a whole game like this.

Plus he naturally regains health and so it's more like a third person shooter rpg. I would love to see a game where you get to steal weapons, add them to your arsenal. Gotta collect ammo, but keep it sort of scarce. Or instead of stealing the weapon a second time, if they hold the same weapon you have equipped you simply get ammo for it. The  something like resonance of fate where you can customize the guns. Rpg like. 

I feel square is sitting on something that could truly be amazing. Prompto is also the only character of the four who had a background. A past full of darkness and mystery (they failed to really explore...). And I just love the goofball. So maybe seeing him after the events of the main game having to deal with a new threat would be awesome.

46,,FFXV,"I didn't know whether to post here or to the KH subreddit, but I figured that this place would have more people that are aware of the development process of Versus XIII which later on turned out to be FFXV. I've been googling a lot of things and since I'm not familiar as to what happened in the long development process, I was hoping that someone could give me some answers or just correct me if (when) I get some things wrong. I'll try and make a TLDR at the bottom. 

So to summarize, the KH3 Re:Mind DLC (spoilers) had a (actually two) secret ending which basically recreated a VXIII trailers opening frames. It has Yozora (character strongly resembling Noctis) waking up in a car. There are lots of comparison videos online, if you want to check it out. But basically that and earlier references to VsXIII and FFXV have been interpreted by lots of people as a sign that Nomura is 'salty' about losing Versus XIII and that he will make it (versus) no matter what. Now I'm here not to discuss as to whether or not Nomura will try to recreate the project, but I'm here to ask why Nomura would be salty. 

I'll now write something based on things I've read and how I've experienced them. Correct me if I'm wrong during any of this. VsXIII was revealed in 2006 with a cinematic trailer and as the years progressed more and more trailers came, but no actual release dates/signs of the game being close to release. I've understood that there's been also development hell surrounding the project, with lots of troubles regarding game engines (?) etc. The game was later renamed (don't know what's the correct word here) to FFXV in 2013, and Nomura was removed (?) in 2014. Then Square said that 

&gt;This move allows Tetsuya Nomura to focus his full efforts as the director of other highly anticipated titles, including Kingdom Hearts III

So Nomura had been working on a title for 8 years, and according to Tabata the game had been 20-25% complete before it became FFXV. So clearly not nearly ready and Nomura had to move on to other projects, like KH3 which was already highly anticipated at the time. This is where my question as to why Nomura is or even would be salty? He had a lot of time to develop the game and although a lot of the roadblocks weren't created/caused by him, he had to have understood that it was time to move on. Also I feel like FFXV pretty much did justice to Versus XIII and things that Nomura had created. This is just based off of my personal gameplay experience of FFXV and watching Versus trailers but the two seem to have had a lot of similiar ideas and themes. Surely some differences (Stella vs Lunafreya, Fabula Nova Crystalis) but that would be inevitable when you consider a creative process that span upon over 10 years. But even in the very first trailer of versus there are things that carried over to FFXV. From my point of view it seems like XV respected the ideas/groundwork that Nomura had laid out for Versus. For gods sake Nomura's name is the only one that you see on the title screen. So do you think that Nomura feels like he's been unjustifiably removed from Versus XIII and that square took away his dream project?

As for another note now that I've gotten excited about the future of KH, I've stumbled into a lot lot of comment sections praising Versus and bashing XV. That just seems like the biggest circlejerk I've probably ever seen. Like how can you love a game that you never got to play, that you've mostly just seen pre-rendered gameplay and trailers. It wasn't even a complete game and nobody knew what the story would be, but I've seen people saying things like 'Stella was the perfect antagonist' and 'it was everything I liked in a video game'. Like how can someone say such things and be serious? To me it seems like VsXIII is something that a lot of people have created their own unique versions in their head, and now have collectively decided that it was an amazing game. When it really wasn't even a complete game.

But yeah I'd appreciate it if anybody wants to share their thoughts about these things with me and answer some of the things I've yet to understand. Also feel free to correct me if I stated something obviously wrong, I'm a little hazy about the facts since I'm completely new to FF as a whole. Hope that this was managable to read, since English isn't my first language.

52,,FFXV,"that maybe Versus 13 was initially intended to be Versus Kingdom Hearts... people seem to think Nomura created Yozora and that whole thing out of pettiness for having lost FFXV and Noctis, but i think this was his plan all along..but for Noctis

the first versus trailer came out in 2006, just one year after KH2! and if i remember correctly back around that time it was being compared alot to KH, and looking back at that trailer now it does feel more like KH than FF..but with blood :P

so my theory is that Nomura wanted to use that unnamed protagonist (that later became Noctis) in his own series that would run parallel to KH and then eventually cross over in KH3.. like KH but without disney and really dark..heck, maybe OG Noctis kingdom was in the realm of darkness!

but square was going in hard with the FNC so it ended up there as versus 13, and then later became FFXV..and when he basically lost custody of Noct he couldn't/ didn't want to go through with his original idea..delaying KH3..

but now he's doing it with new characters.. im curious to see where he's going with this.. i love FFXV, its probably my favorite game of all times, but i wouldn't mind seeing Nomura's original vision come to life in the KH univers.. but then again, Yozora is cool and all but he ain't no Noct..

the more i think about this the more clues and similarities i see

a while back i made a [theory post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXV/comments/ds2ncr/a_theory_on_what_happend_with_xvs_story_cuts/) about how i think the moon was gonna play a part in the FFXV story but was cut late in production leading to the story feeling wonky in some parts.. i was gonna make a follow up with a theory about how the moon would have played in but i never got around to it

i think the moon would have played much the same roll as Etro's gate would have in the original concept, collecting the souls of the dead, ~~it would probably also have been closely connected to Luna lol.~~ if that was the case it would make sense for Ardyn to spread the starscourge to turn people in to daemons so that our protagonists would kill them and fuel the moon, until something.

now, replace the moon with kingdom hearts, Ardyn with Xehanort, and the daemons with heartless and you basically have a twist on the KH basic concept!

at first i was like ""this is too much like KH, it can't be right, Nomura wouldn't create 2 stories that similar""but now with the Yozora stuff im starting to think there might be something to this and that he created the Versus world to be a dark parallel to KH, with a similar but darker story and without disney.

basically sora= realm of light, OG Noctis= realm of darkness, and they are connected by the realm of dreams!  back in the day Noctis whole deal was that he slept alot :P and Sora sure does alot of dreaming! nomura has said that Noct and Sora are complete opposites in many ways, but there are alot connecting the 2 of them!

nothing is either good or bad, only thinking makes it so

The fight receives so much hype and build. There's a lot of tension and drama and intrigue with the Empire and Luna and Ardyn and Ravus and of course our heroes all being there.  Leviathan proves to be quite...willful and it's up to Noct to prove himself to this goddess.

The music is some of the best in the game - which is saying something.

The visuals are amazing for both phases.

Noct is overcome with a mix of anguish and fury and desperation and we can feel that, too.

I don't think any of these factors were in such perfect alignment in any other fight. It's equal parts emotional and awesome and just plain fun.

87,,FFXV,"I'm really not one to pour my heart out online but I thought I'd post this. Hopefully no one makes fun of me, haha.  

A year ago today I was introduced to the Final Fantasy series, for the first time, by my brother. At the time I was going through some heavy depression after several stressful events in my life. I was pretty much at my lowest point and needed something to do while I was recovering from a small injury (nothing major) and a really bad common cold. 

So my brother downloaded some games on Steam for me and we started Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition. Again, I had never played a Final Fantasy game nor any RPGs, either. I had zero expectations. I didn't know about Versus XIII or the controversy surrounding the game. I was just excited for something new to focus on.  

I could could go on about how much fun I had while playing the game but I'll keep it short and sweet. I  *loved* the music, which is what stood out to me first. Valse Di Fantastica/Sunset Waltz, Noctis and Stand By Me are songs that I still hum constantly. I really appreciated the focus on friendship/brotherhood and loved the four main characters. I grew so attached to them actually that when I was accidentally spoiled about &gt;!Noctis' fate I forced myself to believe it wouldn't happen and when it finally did, I was heartbroken but satisfied with the ending. !&lt; Noctis and Prompto are both characters who I could really relate with and the relationship between the four reminded me of what friends I do have, as well as my brother. Not only that, but the theme of living on even after the death of a loved one is something that resonated with me deeply. 

It didn't take me very long to beat the game, about three weeks of playing every day and after school, but in that time I started to feel happier and still, I find it silly that a video game is what helped me through such a slump.

Today I see a lot of people say video games are bad for you, and I think this stigma is slowly fading but as an addition FFXV didn't keep me inside, it inspired me to do the things I thought were the most fun in-game, besides, riding giant birds. 

I kept pursuing my passion for photography, I decided for the first time, ""Why not go camping?"" and ended up going and loving it. I started hiking and going fishing with my dad which he was surprised by. I got into Florence + The Machine and after a year of an art block, I started drawing again. 

Now, video games are just another hobby of mine like the ones above. Final Fantasy XV introduced me into the series as a whole, I ended up playing FFX last summer and I'm very excited for the FFVII remake. I also ended up playing some other RPGs, because of the amazing in-game voice actors, which I never would have thought of doing before. 

I was going through a lot of hardship last year but in short Final Fantasy is just one thing that helped me move on.

I am late to the party, it took me a long time to get XV for PC and even longer to play it, and then even longer to complete it. 

Honestly I've hated this game for the first half of the game, it's obviously a ""first try"" for the FF series in a lot of the things it does, the Open World aspect can be weird, the combat is sometimes sluggish and sometimes on point, the enemies just kinda stand there while you hammer on them and then attack you without feedback or anything.

The game isn't perfect, at all. But one thing always stood out to me: the relationship between the four main characters, every time I camped, every time we talked, every time they would come up with random quips at each other, or compliment each other's combat, it all was very unique for a game, so I stood around to see where the story went.

But that finale. That finale hit me so hard, from the moment you pick your picture from the ones you saved, to Regi dealing the final blow, the final camp scene. 

I cried like a baby through it all, I loved every moment of it, I can say that this game's journey was worth it, through all the ups and downs the boys were always there, and in the end it's because of their relationship that this game was elevated from being a game that I only wanted to ""get over with"" to see the story, to one of my favorite stories in recent JRPGs, to the point of wanting to find stories like it.

133,,FFXV,"Dear community,

after a long break I’ve decided to return to Eos and want to find out, what happened content-wise over the last 2 years.

I finished the game in 2017 with about 117 hours. I hit max level with all characters (120) and stopped playing around the time Comrades came out. I finished some of the post game dungeons (missing e.g. Costlemark tower) and still have some hunts to do.
I killed Naglfar and a high level mark on a military base (can’t remember the name).
I also finished Pitioss.
As I’ve discovered, a lot of content updates were released over the last 2 years. I have the official strategy guide, which is quite detailed but missed the updated content of course.

So I guess my question is, what are some of the biggest changes and new content that I should check out? I downloaded the Royal Pack FYI.
Oh, and has level scaling of the enemies been added to the New Game+?

Thanks in advance!",t2_mq2eo,False,,0,False,Getting back into the game,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THOUGHTS + RUMORS'}]",r/FFXV,False,6,theoriesrumors,0,,False,t3_epfpcc,False,light,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},THOUGHTS + RUMORS,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1579186084.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.FFXV,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear community,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for you help.&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, that's a lot they added there.  So they completely abandoned the other three platforms, left them in an unfinished state, only to release it on Stadia with tons more functionality (and apparently cutscenes that were not in the main game.  Like I don't remember that Titan ground punch, but then again I never could summon him, so who knows.)

And doing that Magitek rush, if it's with your storyline Noctis, would be interesting.  Too bad it requires Stadia.

Likely the Stadia internal announcement got them thinking: ""hmm...so we can make MORE money on that subscription model there...Let's just cancel the other platforms and make up an excuse"".

171,,FFXV,"I know I'm late to the party but I just played through FFXV Royal Edition, which I got earlier this week. Finished the main story and I liked it very much.

 The story is almost archetypal and in a way very simple, with parallels and almost stereotypical characters. But what made me like the game more, was how the relationships were built. I jumped into the game without watching any movies or reading any backstories, and I loved the way I just immediately was a part of this group of friends. They interacted with each other quite naturally and I truly felt their struggles and emotions, especially at the end. 

The carelessnes of the beginning turned quickly into a more serious quest, and at the end everything started to go downhill pretty fast. The game created a false sense of security with it's slow start and that's why I think every tragedy, fight and interaction between the guys felt more real towards the end. 

As I have read some online forums after completing the game, I've found people complaining over the convoluted and complicated plot, which makes me glad that I didn't dive into the lore too much. I didn't care about some plotholes that there may have been, because to me the story was rather simplistic in its core. So I might have a completely different perspective to this game, than some other fans who have spent hours upon hours catching up with the games lore, and that's fine to me. Great thing about literature, paintings, games, music or any kinds of art is that we can enjoy and interpret them subjectively. 

Of course this wasn't the worlds best game, that's obvious. But it's what I was searching for right now. Combat was interactive and fun, exploration was simple but rewarding, side quests or hunts didn't feel completely useless. The world was beautiful and diverse, and the story+characters were good. 

I don't really know as to why I wrote this, this game just really was the right game at the right time for me. I guess I just wanted to appreciate the good things that it did. After some time I'll probably dive more into the side content, altough right know going back to the camping and hunting wouldn't probably feel quite right. 

Altough this was a great experience I probably wont buy other FF games since the turn based combat is a major turn off for me. Also as far as I know they are quite different from this one aswell, altough as I've now gotten to know, they seem to be much more liked by the FF community, or atleast not as divisive.

190,,FFXV,"Hello people,

After playing the unpatched game at its release on XB1 (without the DLC) and then playing the Windows Edition with Steam,

I can say i have finished the game and can uninstall after 241 hours and the 97 Achievements:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFweQbJV7iXY593p9xz9jnUmgWoVDVpjX5Lu5k6Ji5U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFweQbJV7iXY593p9xz9jnUmgWoVDVpjX5Lu5k6Ji5U/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a sheet in french i made for collection purpose

There are several things you will see I have that i shouldn't (Feather photo filter, Medjay Shield and Outfits, JM5 Sticker, Assassin's Stickers, Choco Sticker, and 2 Accessories)

I successfully added all the RED stuff too but it seems there is something that need to be checked in the savefile to confirm having them (Sims outfit, T-shirsts (I didn't preorder), Katana Dodanuki (Windows Store only), Cup Noodle Helmet)

I hope some will find it useful (after some translation) and bid you good game

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Comrades was a slog and i have some friend to thanks for the help to get through it BUT the story was really enjoyable (after several hours of grind after each bit of story)

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFweQbJV7iXY593p9xz9jnUmgWoVDVpjX5Lu5k6Ji5U/edit?usp=sharing""&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFweQbJV7iXY593p9xz9jnUmgWoVDVpjX5Lu5k6Ji5U/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sheet in french i made for collection purpose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several things you will see I have that i shouldn&amp;#39;t (Feather photo filter, Medjay Shield and Outfits, JM5 Sticker, Assassin&amp;#39;s Stickers, Choco Sticker, and 2 Accessories)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I successfully added all the RED stuff too but it seems there is something that need to be checked in the savefile to confirm having them (Sims outfit, T-shirsts (I didn&amp;#39;t preorder), Katana Dodanuki (Windows Store only), Cup Noodle Helmet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope some will find it useful (after some translation) and bid you good game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Comrades was a slog and i have some friend to thanks for the help to get through it BUT the story was really enjoyable (after several hours of grind after each bit of story)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:The informations are accurate since I first followed the official guide then each chapter i did go to each quest location to confirm because as alway, the Offi Guide was full of bad information&lt;/p&gt;

Korean developer [JSC Games](http://www.jscgames.com/) have announced today (via various news outlets, such as the [FNTimes](http://www.fntimes.com/html/view.php?ud=202001071305554049ee0209bd21_18), and [CSTimes](http://www.cstimes.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=326269)) that they are jointly developing the *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* (tentative name) with [GAEA](https://www.gaea.com/) and [Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group](https://www.opg.cn/cn/), based upon Square-Enix's *FINAL FANTASY XV*. The game will also be published by Shanghai Oriental Pearl for the Chinese market.^1

The new game has a few differences to the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* previously released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and most recently for Microsoft Windows. 

The story is set within another world parallel to the world of *FINAL FANTASY XV* and begins immediately after Prince Noctis and his retinue begin their journey. Players will become the protagonist and travel the world with friends in order to save it from various threats. Other new content will be included, such as the previously existing world map being expanded upon with new areas such as continents floating in the sky. 

Unlike the gameplay of original release of *FINAL FANTASY XV*, the new mobile game has been characterized as the following: 

&gt; * The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is being developed as a large-scale MMORPG using the Unreal Engine 4.
&gt; 
&gt; * They aim to go beyond the single-player scope of combat present in the original *FINAL FANTASY XV* by providing a variety of battles for players to cooperate with other players to complete.
&gt; 
&gt; * Gameplay involves simple touch controls.

Park Ji-young, CEO of JSC Games said, “The *FINAL FANTASY XV Mobile MMORPG* is a game with an immersive story, fascinating characters, and it captures the unique sensibility of a Japanese RPG. We are committed to doing our best to bring both the action and graphics of the console experience to mobile.”

Additionally, a trailer will be released during the first half of this year, but an exact date has yet to be confirmed. 

No release date or comprehensive information about what regions the game will be released in has been announced.

&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/cltPnYY""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/cltPnYY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone know who she is? She&amp;#39;s pretty detailed so someone put work into her clothes and stuff. I&amp;#39;ve heard before that an important female character was cut from the game late in its development - could that be her.&lt;/p&gt;

261,,FFXV,"So, I made a thread about this already. It was last year or something, long ago, I don't really know when and honestly I don't feel like searching for it again. I may have made two threads even.

These are my specs

* Windows 10 Pro
* Intel core i5 7600K 3.80 GHz
* 16 GB RAM
* NVIDIA 1060 GTX 6 GB RAM

I am running the game on 1920x1080 and with texture quality High, everything else is Low or disabled. I will say right away that at times, I was playing on everything high and everything low, kind of flip-flopping between them because I didn't know when the issue was still there or not, it occurs either way and here it is:

My game

1. crashes randomly for no apparent reason
2. runs perfectly at 60 FPS but in certain fights (I tried Naglfar just now and it crashed) the FPS drop down to like 10 for a few seconds before recovering, with struggling to do so.
3. Sometimes nothing really happens (the chocobros running or standing around, doesn't really matter) and the FPS drop down to 1 for a full second before going back to 60.

So I had these issues in the past already, around release of the PC version, and I tried asking people about it. People told me to use this ""Virtual Memory"" option that creates a pagefile.sys (It is 16 GB big right now, probably filled up while I was playing before it eventually crashed today) I enabled it and the issue seemed resolved.
Apparently it was because of a RAM leak?

But as I continued the game the issues just came back for no apparent reason. The memory leak issue kind of vanished for people and some of my friends even said that ""it was fixed"", but I don't seem to have any changes and my game crashes/lags still as much as it did on release.

When asking on reddit or people in the FFXV Discord people were like ""well, I speedrun the game and have no issue. It must be your system of some sort.""

Today I tried playing it again and was enjoying myself for about an hour or two until it just crashed again. I REALLY want to know why this is still going on for me and I can't wrap my head around it. Is my system outdated? I can play many other games just fine, including games that are newer. I don't know if its just the PC port having issues or my system at this point, really.

The real kicker for me was when my friend told me that he had ZERO issues playing the game: never crashed for him, never lagged for him. Constant 60 FPS without any trouble, smoothest experience ever, and his system is actually weaker. He had a GTX 960 (at the time) 12 gigabytes of RAM and Windows 7. He was running it on an HDD too. I just don't understand how he never had to deal with this stuff but I do.

333,,FFXV,"I have an issue with my recently bought Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition from PS Store.

I enjoyed the original vanilla experience years ago, somewhat.

I was very psyched about getting a chance to play the game with all of its DLC episodes and new performance updates on PS4.

As usual the PS4 UI would ask upon download which of the many (+20) said DLC items I would like to install. Unfortunately, I was not aware the game would install some of the said add-ons in the Royal Edition without my consent. This includes unwanted DLC such as ""Item: Travel Set"", ""Item: Gourmand Set"", ""Item: Angler Set"", ""Booster Pack"" and ""Booster Pack+"", all of which I absolutely do not want to interfere with my gameplay experience.

The worst offenders being probably the Travel Set which cuts 50% off from all in-game hostel prices and fuel and somesuch ""travel expenses."" I have no intention to make the game any easier for me than it already was. If anything I'd prefer a way to make it more challenging.

This is supposed to be ""optional content"", but right now – for me – I can not find a way to get rid of said content.

I have tried deleting and reinstalling the game now countless times. I only seem to be able to control the installation of the larger DLC episodes, but not any of the previously mentioned files.

I've been in contact with my regional PlayStation customer support but they are not offering me any help to fix the license issue.

As far as I know, my PSN profile and thus the game is now forever tainted with said add-ons that cannot be undone if I wish to play the game in the latest 1.29.

If only I had bought all the wanted DLC individually **one by one** and perhaps I could've evaded this issue.

341,,FFXV,"Hi guys, just got back in the game after buying my new rig. It's running fairly smooth at 70 FPS on Ultra with Pure Light shaders, but sometimes I'll just enter a battle and it bogs down the game to 17-18 FPS and stays there, regardless of me pausing, alt-tabbing or killing every enemy. It just jumps staight from 70 to 17 FPS, and it takes about a minute before it climbs back up super-fast to 70 FPS.

It's not like I see my system dropping a couple of frames when a lot of stuff is happening on screen. It literally jumps from 70 to 17 instantly, and locks itself to that framerate. Luckily, it happens only a couple times per game session, but it's really bothering me.

What exactly is causing this to happen? I am hovering fairly close to my 8GB vRAM all the time, around 7.5GB, but my monitoring software doesn't record it breaking the 8GB, so I'm not sure that's the issue.

SETTINGS:

\- 1440p resolution, 120fps in settings

\- All Ultra, with VXAO off, lighting High instead of Very High, and Filtering to Low

\- ReShade with Pure Light preset (I tried toggling it off and on when the bug happens, and I stay locked at 17-18fps. It's not ReShade or a hardware performance issue....)

\- EDIT: I tried setting TRAM to High instead of Highest and that didn't fix the problem.

My story, like many others, I completed the game and now am in Chapter 15 doing random stuff (2 dungeon keys left and Pitoss). Completed all other quests up to this point, have all the fish, all the dishes, all the hunts. So I've tried to do almost everything.  


Well, I now decided to buy the Royal Edition and have the dilemma that so many have asked about. How do I go play the new chapter 14. My understanding is that I have a few options but all of them have negative, please correct me if I'm wrong:  


1 - start a NG+ and play everything from scratch  
2 - use chapter select to start from chapter 14 and again I lose progress on a lot of stuff that Ive just recently completed in chapter 15  
3 - start the chapter 14 intro quest from chapter 15 but then miss out on loot, boss fight, cut scenes etc.  


Couple questions :  


A - if I do a NG+ or chapter select (my understanding these work the same way), will my list of fish caught, recipes all still be there?  
B - I think I might be looking at this issue all wrong with wanting to have everything on 1 save when in fact thats not really necessary. At the end of the day whats the lesser of 3 evils above?

\*Disclaimer: The Episode DLCs tend to have spoilers for the ending, so if it's your first time playing I'd definitely move those to the end.

\*\* Note: Dawn of the Future doesn't have an english version available yet. I just put it at the end based on what I read the story will be about.

Final thoughts: I haven't played since 2017. Back then my opinion was that this was a really good FF game, but suffered due to some terrible pacing and story telling in the back half. Obviously, the ending was as good as any in a game even back then in spite of the lacking second half. My opinion after replaying with all the content is that the story is as good as any other FF story as a whole, but is really held back by the fact that it's spread across entertainment mediums and requires making a guide on which order it should be experienced in. If Square Enix would've just cut the spoilers from the episode DLCs, inserted little prompts to play them in the right spot, and found a way to work the rest of this content into the actual game (e.g. replacing the opening cutscene with the omen trailer), then FFXV would go toe-to-toe with the greats in the series.

My PS4 got stolen along with the physical hard CD of the game after I beat FFXV and only one of the downloadable DLCs (episodes).

Who is she, and who is she waiting for?\n\n**Nomura:** I can\'t reveal that yet. But I can say that whoever she is waiting for, Sora knows their name.""\n\nThus, this can\'t be Strelitzia since Sora hasn\'t heard the name Lauriam yet, which Strelitzia would only know her brother as at the time of her death. Yozora, though, is on the table, since he heard that name back in Toy Box and it\'d explain the surprise/confusion he had at hearing it, since he only knew Yozora as a video game character at that time.\n\n\\---\n\nBut beyond this, let\'s also take a look at the Nameless Star cutscene itself and view this in a meta sense, particularly in regards to the NS\'s remarks:\n\n**Sora: ""So, whose heart are you?""**\n\n**NS: ""No one\'s anymore. They took away my name--everything about me.""**\n\nThis could go either way, but what if this is actually referring to Square Enix taking away Versus along with the concept of Stella? In both senses, SE took away Nomura\'s VXIII and most of its concepts and turned it into FFXV, which included taking away Stella\'s name and being to create Luna.\n\n**Sora: ""No way. They \\[SE\\] couldn\'t have taken away your heart \\[Versus/Stella\\].""**\n\n**NS: ""Only because it pines for another.""**\n\nAnd this ""another"" can either be interpreted as the original creator behind the Versus XIII concept itself - Nomura - or Noctis, the original love interest for Stella.\n\n**Sora: ""Yeah? Someone\'s \\[VXIII director (Nomura)/Noctis\\] coming for you?""**\n\n**NS: ""I cannot be certain. He\'s \\[VXIII director (Nomura)/Noctis\\] been changed beyond recognition--his heart replaced with another\'s.""**\n\nAdmittedly, I think this part more so closes in on Noctis after he was taken away from Nomura and changed into the Noctis we know now in XV, hence ""his heart replaced with another."" Alternatively though, I believe it could also be interpreted as Hajime Tabata, the director of FFXV, referring to how Nomura was replaced with Tabata as the director of the project.\n\n**NS: ""But, were he \\[FFXV director (Tabata)/FFXV Noctis\\] to regain his old self \\[VXIII director (Nomura)/VXIII Noctis\\] again, he would be distressed by my absence \\[Versus/Stella\\].""**\n\nAs we can probably infer, Nomura still holds onto his ideas for Versus and wishes to use them, just as VXIII Noctis was connected to Stella.\n\n**NS: ""So I choose to wait here, where he \\[Nomura/VXIII Noctis\\] can find me.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Good. You have to believe.""**\n\n**NS: ""Believe? Oh, you mean know in my heart he will return? Without any proof? \\[without certainty that this idea would come to fruition someday\\]""**\n\n**Sora: ""Exactly, believe. I thought it was all over for me, but a friend of mine looked me in the eye and said, \'You don\'t believe that.\'""**\n\n**Sora: ""So, uh...who did this to you? Heartless steal hearts, so...a Nobody?""**\n\n**NS: ""A...somebody.""**\n\nAgain, looking at NS\'s responses, this could allude to the uncertainty of Nomura getting to realize his ideas. And as for somebody, this could be a blanket term for SE or alternatively (although in a direct light) Tabata changing VXIII into XV and Stella into Luna.\n\n**Sora: ""Really? Hmm... Well, I wish I could help, but my situation\'s no better.""**\n\n**NS: ""You must see to the tasks before you first.""**\n\n**Sora: ""The tasks before me? There\'s so many.""**\n\n**NS: ""All the more reason for you to make an effort.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Yeah, you\'re right. I just wish I knew what to do.""**\n\nAll of this, I\'m admittedly not as sure on and think is a bit shaky. The closest I can imagine is Sora representing KH3 or the KH series at large, in that KH3/KH must attend to its own current story first, of which Nomura has so many ideas he plans to use and needs to resolve first before jumping into his old Versus XIII concepts. Hence, ""all the more reason for \\[KH\\] to make an effort"" to settle its story (with the Remind DLC). At the point in time this was still being developed, it\'s possible not all the ideas and plans for the DLC were decided upon, aka ""I just wish I knew what to do.""\n\n**NS: ""Here you \\[KH\\] are on the brink, and yet you hold on to who you are. You possess a strong sense of purpose. And in that purpose you will find direction.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Thank you. I\'m really glad we met. You cheer me up. I hope that friend of yours \\[Nomura/VXIII Noctis\\] finds you soon.""**\n\n**NS: ""Thank you. Me too.""**\n\n**Sora: ""Oh, hey. If I see him, I\'ll tell him that you\'re here. What\'s his name?""**\n\n**NS: ""(Says the name) \\[Nomura/Noctis aka Yozora\\] Our secret \\[in that this is still unrevealed as of now\\].""**\n\nThe irony is that KH is wishing Versus XIII/Stella to be found soon, when it is now actually being integrated into KH, ala the result of ""I\'ll tell him you\'re here."" Except, it\'s now under the idea of Verum Rex becoming the new Versus and Yozora becoming the new Noctis. And tying this into the concept of TFW itself being the place between sleep and death, Versus XIII is a concept that was thought to be killed by FFXV and has waited in sleep for Nomura to bring his ideas back to life.

445,,FFXV,"Hello Guys. First off here's my rig: [https://imgur.com/f7rIJYM](https://imgur.com/f7rIJYM)

The Problem: Game normally runs smooth 60 fps at all times, but starts stuttering when I have too many enemies on screen (threshold seems to be two red giants (flamey swords?) for the lag to occur)  This problem persists even when !!!I'm playing on Low settings with 50% resolution!!! (1080p) (tho much rarer but it's still an annoyance)

I even took the excuse to upgrade my cpu and ram. Still persists.

I'm really dunno what I have to do now to fix it. In the tower dungeon with the 20+ mobs on ground lvl it's practically unplayable, even tho GeForce Experience set's my presets to ""Highest"" Yeah... no........

Any ideas what i could do? Thanks in advance. o/

I had low expectations going into this game because the last couple Final Fantasy games could never hook me like they used to.

The open world stuff was fun but the game couldn't hook me like I wanted it to. The story didn't grab me at all. 

I recently picked it up again and finished chapter 9. Finally the game grabbed me and I ended up finishing the rest of the chapters over the past week. This is instantly a classic Final Fantasy for me now. People seemed to not like it once the open world closed off and the story became more focused but that's exactly what I wanted.

Which character from the Final Fantasy XV world has made a memorable impression on you? The answers can be from the main characters to the supporting/minor characters (e.g. Cor, Iris, Talcott, Sania Yeagre, Kenny Crow). I favor more than one character, though I list my top three:

* **Regis**, as I sympathize for the onerous weight on his shoulders. From losing his wife Aulea, to raising Noctis alone while defending Insomnia and the citizens. Seeing Regis do what he could to protect Noctis, the people of Insomnia, to Clarus in the battle against Glauca. I have pondered if Regis was ever informed who Ardyn truly was before his death and what Somnus has done to his brother.
* **Ardyn** is to me a sadistic and troglodyte character for abandoning his humanity to hurt people and Noctis who did not wrong him, though the story from Episode Ardyn and the notes from Dawn of the Future helps provide an explanation on why Ardyn is malicious toward the Caelum household. He suffered greatly to be forced in a fate that felt like a great deception, to heal the infected by absorbing the starscourge to being rejected by the Crystal and later told by Bahamut that his role was to shroud Eos in darkness. If I remember correctly Ardyn did not ever learn whether or not Aera was informed what was going to happen to him or whether Somnus knew of Ardyn's fate, so being left with unanswered questions placed a heavy sadness on the character.
* **Noctis** story is a tragic journey he was burdened with, as his fate to give his life for Eos was a cruel preordained decision from the Crystal. Each chapter in the game leading to the final battle was immersive to me and the many interesting people Noctis and his friends encountered were intriguing or amusing. The war with Nifelheim (and Ravus watching cautiously over his sister) was preventing Lunafreya and Noctis to see each other was hurtful, and I did sympathize with the pain Luna and Noctis felt. The only time the two can be together was in the mist of the battle, and that time was only brief and chaotic, no time for the couple to breathe. The bond with Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto and the obstacles that challenged their will and strength was a good example of brotherhood and friendship.",t2_4khwcj2e,False,,0,False,Is there a character that left an impression on you?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'THOUGHTS + RUMORS'}]",r/FFXV,False,6,theoriesrumors,0,,False,t3_e6e5d0,False,light,,public,27,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},THOUGHTS + RUMORS,False,27,,False,spoiler,1577011764.0,,[],{},,,True,,1575561826.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.FFXV,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first apologise if another member has make a thread like this one or if this not an interesting topic, I only want to see what other avid players feel on the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Does the Royal Pack add any new cutscenes that weren’t included with the free patches?

How do they not know all 13 locations if each king before Noct has collected them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize if this has already been asked or if it’s explained in other media that I just haven’t come across. But to my knowledge, none of this is explained in game.&lt;/p&gt;

551,,FFXV,"I recently bought the game on Stadia and I feel like I'm missing something with the story. I just reached chapter 2, here is my confusion in a nutshell:

&amp;#x200B;

1) When the game starts you're randomly heading for Atlassia (sp?) without any preamble, introduction, or explanation

2) At the end of Chapter 2 there was a cut-scene of Insomnia under attack. The cut-scene had 0 dialogue and 0 explanation for what was happening

3) After trying to reach Insomnia, I got a call from some random person named Col who told me to go back to Hammerhead

4) When I reached Hammerhad I was directed to talk to Cid. Cid says one sentence that went something like ""It was a ruse to get the crystal and the ring"" without further explanation of what those things were and why it was important.

&amp;#x200B;

I just reached chapter 2, here is my confusion in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) When the game starts you&amp;#39;re randomly heading for Atlassia (sp?) without any preamble, introduction, or explanation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) At the end of Chapter 2 there was a cut-scene of Insomnia under attack. The cut-scene had 0 dialogue and 0 explanation for what was happening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) After trying to reach Insomnia, I got a call from some random person named Col who told me to go back to Hammerhead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) When I reached Hammerhad I was directed to talk to Cid. Cid says one sentence that went something like &amp;quot;It was a ruse to get the crystal and the ring&amp;quot; without further explanation of what those things were and why it was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

572,,FFXV,"So when this game launched I bought it day one and played it 100 some hours and 100% the available content. I loved playing it. This was on Xbox One. When the DLC dropped I never bothered to pick it back up or try any of them. I was debating on buying it for PS4 but buying it on PS4 I would have to do everything over again before playing DLC. Do you think it's worth it to buy on another console or to just buy it on xbox one and play the DLC?

I know this is an odd question it's just I dont know if I have it in me to put 100 hours into the main game again. Which is odd since I loved it when I played it.

I loved playing it. This was on Xbox One. When the DLC dropped I never bothered to pick it back up or try any of them. I was debating on buying it for PS4 but buying it on PS4 I would have to do everything over again before playing DLC. Do you think it&amp;#39;s worth it to buy on another console or to just buy it on xbox one and play the DLC?&lt;/p&gt;

688,,FFXV,"Hi!

Need help (badly).

It’s not that fps goes down according to the readings it just freezes and then it’s smooth again for maybe a second then freezes again. All the time during the fight and it’s getting me killed. Any ideas on what I can do to solve this?

My specs:

Playing on 1080p resolution with 125% scaling.

Playing everything on High except shadows which is on Average.

No Nvidia effects turned on.

**Microsoft Store &amp; Xbox One**

If you are of the extreme minority who own the game on Xbox One and buy an additional copy for PC on the Microsoft Store, you will find that game saves are shared between the two. Of more interesting benefit is that you can share saves regardless of what DLC you have purchased on Xbox One; despite the PC version coming with all DLC sans Episode Ardyn, progress on the PC version's DLC is gracefully and seamlessly ignored on this save data if you skip back to playing on Xbone without having purchased the requisite DLC. This is very good to know for the extreme minority of people like me who keep multiple versions of the game (personally, PS4 Pro at 1.00/no DLC for best day one experience, Xbox One X with all DLC except Royal for best vanilla experience, PC with ALL the things) and take issue with the horrible state of the Steam version.

767,,FFXV,"From all my time in the game, i've noticed Armiger Warpstrike is 100% legit trash.

It takes pretty long. But the damage is absolutely pathetic. Meanwhile just ""holding O"" in Armiger will do WAY and i mean WAY more damage and it will also gapclose way faster. There is no reason to use Armiger Warpstrike over ""holding O"" while in Armiger mode as far as i know.

This seems to be because Armiger Warpstrike is always only a 1.0x damage multiplier.

However… In the clip i posted below. For some reason. I suddenly get a proper Warpstrike 2.4x Multiplier while in Armiger. And my target actually dies in one hit... The Second target gets the typical 1.0x and doesn't die in one hit... again proving how bad Armiger Warpstrike really is.

In the second clip, i'm pretty far away from the target yet only get a 1.0x multiplier.

I feel like Armiger Warpstrike would actually be useful and damaging if it would get the proper multiplier based on distance. But it doesn't… So it sux.

But my question is. Why am i actually getting a multiplier in that first clip? What's the trick? What am i missing?

774,,FFXV,"I know this hasn't been too much of a debate singe the FFXIV event dropped, giving us the new handgun, Abandon of the Vortex, and it's good and all, but I think his best handgun is really debatable. Between Abandon of the Vortex and Death Penalty, the power difference, including strength bonus, is 6 towards Abandon of the Vortex, a very small number. It gets an increased appendage breaking advantage, which is a small niche. Otherwise, the +50% vulnerable damage is nice, but given the AI of this game, I find it won't be too useful too often. On the other hand, Death Penalty has a 1% chance to inflict Instant Death, which certainly is a small chance. But for similar damage when given the Critical Hit food (sushi), I think that Death Penalty is likely easily far better when against enemies that are susceptible to Instant Death. But when not susceptible, or when not using the Critical Hit food (sushi), it goes back to Abandon of the Vortex. 

I know this is a very small, niche topic to discuss when it's for the Handgun, used by a character that, when you control, isn't going to be using the Handgun much at all, but since I've seen people claim that Abandon of the Vortex is Prompto's best Handgun, I just thought I'd give my input.

It plays about as well on Max settings as it does on low and turning on and off the special options has no effect either. I am using the built in hardware monitor and nothing seems out of line...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

I've had the game for 2 weeks now and I'm at 56 hrs in chapter 10 heading towards Tenebrae.

Now I wonder a few things:
1. Why use Umbra for time travel? And where? Can you do it everywhere?

2. Are the more attires for Noctis?

3. Is there something like a battle dungeon/event/tower, whatever? I think it would be fun since I'm killing through the game at this point at lvl 67.

4. Ring magic? 

5. Can be boat be used to explore otherwise unknown areas/dungeons/quests?

824,,FFXV,"Hi All,

Just wanted to share my observations from a person who has never played any FF games or even been exposed to it.  I am considered at least middle age and I have never enjoyed single player RPG's before, tried many including fallout etc.

I have to say, this one is different.  I have owned it since release, played it maybe 10 minutes on release and just shelved it (windows version)  I have been playing it the last few days and it's really been a joy.

1. The scale and scope of the detailed world is astonishing.  I am a software developer and have been over 30 years.  The level of work in this thing is just amazing to me. 

2. The interactions and story and work among the group is fun and doesn't get old or tired.  So many RPG's and JRPG's that I have tried are repetitive and annoying.  They mix it up well and make it fun and you end up caring about the story and the characters in your group and frankly I have a terrible imagination and still loved it.

3. The depth of the game, I am on chapter 3 but I have gone back to 1 and 2 areas and had fun and am level 21 already because I wanted to do more there with customizing the car and other things.

Just a really fun experience for a guy that has not had much enjoyment with single player RPG's in the past.  I'd highly recommend more than a cursory glance if you are like me and just never really liked them.

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, this one is different.  I have owned it since release, played it maybe 10 minutes on release and just shelved it (windows version)  I have been playing it the last few days and it&amp;#39;s really been a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  SHould mention, i have a SINGLE mod installed.  It's a character model changer.  I'll change it, and see what that does.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: Removal of the mod did nothing.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry to be sarcastic, but this is extremely frustrating to boot up a stream to play this game, and I can&amp;#39;t even get 5 minutes into the game without a crash.  No idea what&amp;#39;s causing this, but for chirst&amp;#39;s sake where have all the bug tests gone.  I&amp;#39;m not even 30 minutes into the game.&lt;/p&gt;

886,,FFXV,"I've been playing this game for a few weeks now. It's fun, but, it starts to run like ass whenever I fight enemies. My FPS constantly drops bewteen 10-20 frames when fighting enemies. Sometimes it even goes down to the single digits.

Also when running / driving around, the game will randomly freeze and drop to 1-2 fps, then return to normal. Like a small loading screen or something.

My laptop's specs:
i5 8300h
GTX 1050ti
16gb ram dual channel
The game is downloaded onto an SSD (crucial mx500).
Using a wireless xbox one controller to play.

I'm running the game on the lowest settings. I can get 55-60 fps when I'm wandering around. But when I battle it runs like ass. I've tried lowering my resolution, setting the resolution scaling to 75%.

It&amp;#39;s fun, but, it starts to run like ass whenever I fight enemies. My FPS constantly drops bewteen 10-20 frames when fighting enemies. Sometimes it even goes down to the single digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when running / driving around, the game will randomly freeze and drop to 1-2 fps, then return to normal. Like a small loading screen or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My laptop&amp;#39;s specs:
i5 8300h
GTX 1050ti
16gb ram dual channel
The game is downloaded onto an SSD (crucial mx500).
Using a wireless xbox one controller to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m running the game on the lowest settings. I can get 55-60 fps when I&amp;#39;m wandering around. But when I battle it runs like ass. I&amp;#39;ve tried lowering my resolution, setting the resolution scaling to 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I have a lower end model but I&amp;#39;ve seen people with higher end pcs have these issues to.&lt;/p&gt;

The first project was a translated version of ""Parting Ways"" in German. Shortly thereafter, I was informed that there is already an official German version. Shame about my time.

The second project is the ""Archive Project."" There are countless collateral materials to Final Fantasy XV. From anime about a movie and spin-off games. And anyone who knows Square knows that it is not certain that this content will always be available.

As an example we would have the two mobile games ""Justice Monsters Five"" and ""King's Knight"". Both can now no longer be played on mobile and the former is only available in the main game at vending machines. That's why the Archive-project was launched.

The goal is to retain as many relevant side-material as possible, to allow players to have the fullest possible experience with Final Fantasy XV.

To put it directly: The archived materials were all obtained legally and in compliance with the (German) law. We are non-commercial and have no personal benefits from this project. We do it all in our free time. We will also post our backups on our website only if certain media are no longer available on official channels (Youtube-Chanel, official websites, etc.) and / or require an absurd price to procure official copies.

As I said. Our goal is to keep future games of Final Fantasy XV open at all times to provide the most complete experience possible.

916,,FFXV,"The only online English translation of the lyrics to this song is a reddit post from a year or so back, and the translation is, to put it nicely, not entirely accurate. Please don't take this as me dumping on OP! Latin is a really difficult language even when written correctly, which the lyrics to this song definitely are not. But it's been bugging me for over a year now, so I finally decided to sit down and put my Latin degree to use.


&amp;nbsp;


This probably isn't 100% accurate either - like I said, the original Latin is dodgy, so there was a lot of having to guess what the author might have *intended* to write rather than translating the grammatical nonsense that they actually wrote. But this is definitely a lot more accurate than the previous translation.

With your face toward me

all so greatly worship my flesh.

&amp;nbsp;


I am the one who throws stones

and steers all lives.

&amp;nbsp;


Heaven, Earth, turned away

And the great, the small, returned

As a mighty leader, I command

the light that you will bind with your voice.

there will come the end of the Apocalypse.

the lives of all here: the darkness.

bringing with it death.

Prepare! Prepare! Prepare! Prepare!

The mighty king, warrior,

sword in hand.

A war in virtue

won over the enemy.


&amp;nbsp;


First comes death

which comes for a certain person.

All prepare! All prepare! All prepare!

I know there is so much dialogue in this game, but I was hoping one of you would be able to help me find a particular line (mainly because I want to prove to myself that I'm not crazy/didn't imagine it), but I very distinctly remember seeing both in game and seeing it posted online where there's one line in the game from Ignis that isn't in his normal accent. It sounds just a wee bit off, like his original English VA's accent, but seemingly wasn't re-recorded with the proper accent. I think it was a post-battle dialogue or idle dialogue from Altissia, but I'm at a loss and can't find it no matter what I Google. I haven't been able to trigger it in game, either.

Was it patched out? Does anyone know what I'm talking about? And if you find a video of it, I would be forever grateful if you could link it to me - thanks!

Edit: Okay, I'm 95% sure the line is ""Didja ya see that, Noct?"" I can hear it in my head, but can't find a video/audio clip of it. If you find it, PLEASE link here - thanks!

&lt;p&gt;Just a small thread to also show apprecition for this demo!&lt;/p&gt;

964,,FFXV,"FFXV Windows Edition is the best version of FFXV to date, mainly because of this sweet, buttery-smooth framerates that you can get... on every store version except Steam. Due to the poor implementation of SteamAPI this version has the worst performance of all, getting stutters and framerate dips out of nowhere. Take a look at this:

Steam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6mBmdQMM8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI6mBmdQMM8)

Origin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJl7Zql5oE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJl7Zql5oE)

Steam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvvjMqwF2gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvvjMqwF2gw)

Microsoft Store: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wmOXWYP\_IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wmOXWYP_IQ)

I can confirm that this is a thing. There is one workaround, you can downgrade game manually to version 1.25 (the last stable Steam release), but doing that also disables some of additional content, including Episode Ardyn compatibility. Sure, you can blaze through the base game and three episodes on 1.25 and then update your game to play Ardyn, but... why bother if you have possibility to buy the game on other store and have zero problems with it? After playing FFXV on PS4 at launch I was eager to replay it on PC, bought the Steam version only to discover that it's stuttery mess. Bought again yesterday on Origin and man... the difference is real.

I have a NewGame+ File and a old Save File where I already finished the game (lvl 64 or smth like that) and a new game with no + content. I tried getting the boat in each of those files or any other content but nothing works. I didn't even recieve a msg that the royal pack dlc was installed, when I opened the game.
